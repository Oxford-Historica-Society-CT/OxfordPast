</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> I have been trying to understand
the &#8220;Tea Bagger&#8221; phenomenon.My thoughts are bought back to the
teaching of Joseph Campbell. He has a central theme in his thesis,
which is: The Mythology of a people must describe the reality they live
in, and their personal relationship to the higher power. When reality
changes the mythology must change to describe the new reality, i.e.
when hunter gathers transition to an agrarian society</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">I have
no idea what mythology or reality you are talking about. Are
you&nbsp;calling Christianity a myth? </font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">When the reality of a people changes,
individuals are left with one of three basic choices<br>
1. Deny the old mythology that does not describe the reality you live in<br>
2. Adapt a new mythology that does describe the reality you live in<br>
3. Deny reality</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">4.
Change reality</font><br>
<br>
For me this denial of reality <font color="#0000ff" size="4">What&nbsp;denial
of reality? <small><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 0);">explains</span></small></font><small><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"> </span></small>the rising tide of
fundamentalism in all faiths across the globe. To deny reality may seem
to be irrational, but it offers a sanctuary for someone who is unable
to rationalize the conflict between their understanding of their faith,
and their observations of reality. <font color="#0000ff" size="4">I
personally have no conflict at all between my faith and my observations
of reality. I see the sun rise and I know God is greater than man.</font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
My view is that the &#8220;Tea Baggers&#8221; fall into this phenomenon as well. I
listen to their rhetoric and I cannot rationalize the logic behind what
they are saying. But you can&#8217;t rationalize irrational behavior; you can
only try to understand it. There are a couple central recurring themes
in Tea Bagger rhetoric:<br>
&#8226; Give me my country back<br>
&#8226; Big multinational corporations are taking over our society&nbsp; <font
 color="#0000ff" size="4">If you believe this, then you do NOT
understand the movement one bit. We are FOR free markets. We do not
fear a free market. We fear that if we are not careful our federal
government will continue to take over more and more of our free
markets. The reality of that is that we would then not be a free people.</font><br>
<br>
They tend to look back to an idealistic view of our founding fathers
world and believe somehow if we could only return to that place in
time, everything would be fine. <font color="#0000ff" size="4">This is
another misconception. It is the PRINCIPLES that our founding fathers
built this nation upon that we want to return to.&nbsp;"<em>We hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness</em>."</font>&nbsp;Of
course we can&#8217;t, but perhaps we can take a clue from them and try to
understand what the issues are. The founding fathers lived in a world
that was so untenable they revolted in the streets. They took up arms
and were willing to shed their blood. &#8220;Give me liberty or give me
death&#8221; was not just a bumper sticker. People felt that they had no
control over their own lives. Decisions were made about the way society
was ordered by outside authority that the people had no voice in.
(sound familiar?)<br>
<br>
Lets strip away the slogans and the passion and look at what actually
happened. When civil society did not meet the needs of the citizenry,
society was reordered specifically to address the concerns of justice
and representation. <br>
&#8226; Does our society today meet then needs of our collective citizenry? <font
 color="#0000ff" size="4">I think you will find that we all have one
thing in common, we all thrive when we are free.</font><br>
&#8226; If society was reordered today to address our current needs what
would it look like?&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff" size="4">A nation
where the People are free to worship as they please, to speak their
mind, to do they work that they enjoy. To provide for their loved ones,
and have the right to protect them. It is what America is all about.</font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
Let&#8217;s assume the Tea Baggers are correct, society needs to be
reordered. Do we fall back to the absolute values of our original
founding fathers? (does this include denial of women&#8217;s suffrage and
reinstitution of slavery?). Or perhaps we take a page from history and
rewrite it. Creating a new foundation that addresses our needs today,
and looking forward to a future based on today&#8217;s reality. <font
 color="#0000ff" size="4">Here again, we do not need a new foundation.
We have a wonderful foundation. It is rooted in Liberty and Justice for
ALL! It is why People from all over the world have been coming here for
hundreds of years. It is why YOUR ancestors came here. </font><br>
<br>
What would that look like? Would we address concepts such as:<br>
&#8226; Universal education for all children, both girls and boys across the
globe&nbsp; </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8226; Adaptation of a common global
language&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff" size="4">I thought we were
supposed to celebrate diversity!</font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8226; Creation of a common global currency<br>
&#8226; Economic justice eliminating the extremes of wealth and
poverty&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff" size="4"> Here is something
you must understand. The wealthy are the job creators! When poor people
have decent&nbsp;jobs, they can lift themselves out of poverty.</font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8226; Regulation of global corporations on
a global scale&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff" size="4">We would do good
to put our own house in order first. If we get it right, the rest of
the world will follow along if they so desire.</font><br>
&#8226; Climate change <font color="#0000ff" size="4">Go to google ... enter
'climategate'. </font><br>
<br>
What actually happened on September 17, 1787? <font color="#0000ff"
 size="4">That is easy. They spelled it out for us very clearly. "We<span
 class="heading"><a name="preamble"><em> the People </em></a></span><em>of
the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to
ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution
for the United States of America." </em></font>(The day our
constitution was signed). Essentially, a collection of independent
sovereign states each relinquished a portion of their sovereignty to a
greater more far reaching sovereignty. The debate over states rights
versus a strong central government goes on today, but I doubt that few
would deny the value in creating The United States. </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
We live in a complex world today; <font color="#0000ff" size="4">What
is so complex?&nbsp;Perhaps you do not believe in God. But I believe
that in the end we all must answer to our Creator. Simple. </font>we
have problems that span the globe. For the first time in the history of
mankind we can address these issues as a global society. Perhaps the
Tea Baggers are right, but rather than look back, we need to move
ahead. We need to address the specific problems of today with the
specific solutions available today.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
My advise to anyone who wants to discount the Tea Baggers as irrational
and irrelevant, is to take a long look at the world we live in, and
don&#8217;t be afraid to see the future as something very different from
today, and hopefully a better place. In the end I have confidence we
will create a society that meets our collective needs in our reality.
Indeed, humanity always has.&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff" size="4"><br>
