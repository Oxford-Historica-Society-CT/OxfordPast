<blockquote><big>Society, a tract on <i>Slavery in Connecticut</i>,
which estimated that in 1755 there were nearly four thousand slaves in
the state, with 226 in New Haven County. She said, "Many of the
ministers of the New Haven Jurisdiction during this and the succeeding
century were slave owners, as were deacons in their churches and other
leading citizens . . . It is said that slaves belonging to the
ministers were distinguished for their piety . . . As for the ministers
it was a fine arrangement. The slaves could do the work on the farms
owned by practically all the ministers. Slavery in Connecticut was
almost a patriarchal institution, and slaves were generally well
treated and often almost as members of the family." <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted in connection to the reference
above to the farms of ministers, that Mansfield had nine acres,
provided for his use by the Derby parish. With his busy schedule
visiting all the families within his large territory, it is not
surprising he would have required some sort of assistance in the
farming endeavors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the less well known of Mansfield's
accomplishments was the introduction of the black walnut tree which was
so fashionable in his age. He brought the tree into the Derby area when
he returned from his 1748 trip to England for his ordination. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a clergyman, Mansfield was a tireless
worker and reported in 1749, after a year's work in his district that
he had in Derby and Waterbury alone one hundred and forty-six
communicants, notwithstanding his people had been sharers in the great
oppressions arising from the system of taxation." In 1758 the church in
Waterbury was taken over by the Rev. James
Scovill, due to the continuing increase in the size of that church. At
this time the church in Derby and Oxford was receiving many new
members. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the time of the American Revolution approached,
the Episcopal clergy faced a new problem - to cope with the sentiments
of the Americans seeking liberty. Because of their association with the
Church of England, the Episcopal clergy were considered highly suspect
by those who supported the American Revolution. Not only were their
associations suspect, but the ordination rites of these clergy had
included an oath of allegiance to the king. The growing strife between
England and her colonies put the Episcopal clergy into a difficult
position.</big></blockquote>
