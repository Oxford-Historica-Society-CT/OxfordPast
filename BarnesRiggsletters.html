Dear Brother and Sister,<br>
I now have a few leisure moments which I am very happy to spend in
writing a few lines to you to let you know my present situation
likewise my future calculations. I am now at work in the Button Factory
at Waterville formerly called Haydensville for Ives Hendrick &amp; Co
at seventy five cents per day and Board, and shall in all probability
continue untill the first of March if not a year at the same price and
if the man that I am to work with does as he talks of I can within the
course of a year get a dollar and a half a day I work at casting and
rolling and he says if the Co, is willing he will learn me all he can
and give it up to me as soon as the first of March I have not spoken to
Mr. Hendrick yet,
but I intend to soon and I think it very probable that he will let me
do it, I board with Austin Painter as I have done for seven months past
and enjoy comfortable health and a comfortable living I have nothing
more in particular to write concerning myself only give my best love to
Esther and the children likewise to all the family especially Marcia
and her little girl and dont forget Lot, kiss them dear little children
once for me and tell Marcie to do me the same kindness I heard from
father about a week ago and he was well and was getting shingles in
Harwinton, he had got a couple of half barrels of fish here which I
expect he is keeping one certain for you. Isaac lives in Winchester I
believe but I have not seen him in about six months but the last I
heard from Wm he was well and his family they have two children as I
suppose you have heard before Father you know has got to be an old gray
bearded man and we must not say by him as the song says poor old horse
let him die we must respect our father and take good care of him and be
a comfort to him in his old age and the Lord will reward us it has now
got to be 10 o'clock and I must retire to rest if God grants I will
finish my letter tomorrow so good night. <br>
Father send me a letter last spring that he received from you stating
that you was coming down here this summer on a visit if you did not
move your family down of which I was very much pleased to hear but I
should be much more so to have you bring them too for I want to see
them two little children I want to see little Tommy very much but I
think that Eliby seems rather nearer to me that he does because I have
lived with her so much, however I dont intend to show any partiality
between them nor between them and Marcie's little Mary, for I want to
see her as much as any one and tell them all that uncle Harvey wants to
see them very much and tell that the same for Grampa tell Eliza that
she must be a good girl mind her parents learn her Book well and if I
every see them I will give her and little Mary each of them a new
bonnet and little Tommy, a new cap, I want to have you tell Marcia that
I want to see her and Lot very much indeed I
want to see Lot for I want to pay him for the trouble that I made him
when I was sick there and tell them both they must write to me
immediately and let me know where they are and how they get along and I
will write to them. I know nothing but what Father and Isaac and his
family are well and respecting your fathers family I have not heard
from them in some time but the last I heard from them they were all
well. I was to have you and Esther write to me immediately and whether
you intend to come down here this fall or not and I hope you will come.
Give my best love to all enquireing friends especially to
mother Pratt, write as soon as you receive this. I must now close my
letter and may the blessings of heaven rest on you all now henceforth
and forever, please to excuse a poor pen poor paper and poor writing,
yours till death.<br>

pen to inform you of my health and
circumstances.
My health is good and my prospects you will say Father thinks are
flattering when I come to tell you what they are unexpected to you I
presume but you know there is one who prepares our hearts and directs
our steps. I will now inform you on the 10th of July, I gave my hand in
Marriage to Mrs. Lucy Palmeter, of Burlington aged 46 years. She is a
woman of my highest esteem and tenderest regard calculated I think to
render the evening of life pleasant and agreeable. We commenced house
keeping August 1st. We live five miles from Plymouth
hollow on the turnpike to Wolcottsville. Your Mother in law is an
industrious, pleasant and agreeable woman, one I presume you would be
pleased to call Mother. Harvey (Riggs) thinks there is nobody like her.
He was up here yesterday to see us and seemed pleased to think that
Father was placed in a situation to enjoy all this transitory world had
to bestow. We have enough of everything to eat and drink. We have about
a hundred
wt. of broad side pork, two half lbs. of fish, butter and cheese hge
and cake and I have just bough a part of lamb, so we are going to have
a stue pye for supper. Now what shall I say expostulations and
entreaties I find are useless
but such are my feelings that I cannot forbear to intreat you to come
and see. Harvey says he thinks by your letter that you have a desire to
come
down this fall which gave animation to his mind although the tears
trickled down his checks when he spoke of Esther "Mrs. M.W. Barnes". I
suppose you know that girl lies near his heart and little tommy
"Barnes" yes all of you I cannot make no distinction for I possess a
parent's heart. I know no odds between Children and Children in law and
their children (Elizabeth excepted). Walter "Myron Walter Barnes" I am
speaking to you and not only you but
all the rest of my children to come and see for themselves, see how
Father does, how he lives and what a pleasant, agreeable woman you have
for a Mother in law. Well by this time you will say Father has wrote
enough of this stuff
but suffer me a little farther. I want to have you tell Elizabeth that
she must come down and live along with Grandma. Now I will turn your
attention to another subject entirely. I want to
have you write to me as soon as you receive this and let me know what
is your determination and calculation and prospects respecting your
coming to Ct. this fall. If you should all live and have your healths
do not say you have no where to go for now you have a Father's house to
come to where you will be kindly received if you see fit to come. We
live in a good house where we can entertain you decently and
comfortably which your Mother and I should feel disposed to do. I want
to have you show this letter to all the children and tell them
that Father wants to have them spend the remainder of their days in old
Ct. Tell Merritt "Riggs" or William "Riggs" and "Lot" Malloy to come
and see Father once more before I shall go to that journey from whence
I shall not return. Tell them that it is an overwhelming thought that I
should never behold
them again in the flesh. I want to have you look on the bright side of
the cloud and not anticipate something that there is no probability of
ever taking place for the trouble that we borrow is of our own
procuring the profet says if we walk in darkness and have no light let
us trust in the name of the Lord and stay upon his God. I suppose you
will all feel anxious to see what Father has got for a
wife but you do not feel more anxious to see her than I do to have you.
You are not all strangers to the scenes that I have had to pass
through. I was called to bear the yoke in my youth you know that
through my life that clouds have intervened but now my sun is on the
decline, the sky is clear and serene and I hope it will remain so until
it shall set forever but I forbear. Now can I say anything that will
induce any or all of you to come. Walter if you or any of you should
come to Ct. be so kind as to call on
Judge Gibbs and give my best regards to him and family and all the
family connections and be sure and get my drawing knife and fro and if
the Judge has collected my money bring it with you if you should come,
if not let him enclose it in a letter directed to Wolcottsville,
Litchfield County, where I wish you to direct yours. Nothing more at
present. Now I must close by subscribing ourselves your affectionate
parents. Our best respects to you all, adieu.</span><br

Samuel Riggs was born
in Litchfield, Connecticut, about 1774-75. On
reaching maturity he first married Catharine Shaw, who lived but a
year, and he then married Betsey Rigby and settled in Oxford,
Connecticut. When their first child was six months old, the mother and
babe removed with Jeremiah and part of his family to Livonia, N.Y.,
where she rejoined her husband Samuel, who had gone there in advance.
They reared a family of eight children, as given below, and after the
death of the mother, Samuel returned to Connecticut, and married a
third wife, who survived the death of her husband, in 1848.</span><br

      <br>
Dear Brother,<br>
knowing that the Destinies of all us all is held in the hand of a
supreme Being and that he knows all our thoughts better than we do
ourselves and knowing that it is our duty to act by the rule or right
and not deceive any one I want to ask you whether you have, when you
have wrote to us wrote your feelings about coming to Ct. I presume you
will say you have but I have some doubts about that for if you want to
come I do not see what there is to hinder. I do not know but you think
if you come back here you will have father to take care of but you need
not trouble yourself any thing about that for father is better off than
any of us for he has got his health and a smart woman to help him and
there is nothing to hinder him from getting a good living. I write to
you to have your write to me and let me know whether you
ever intend to come to this country, if you do I want to have you write
when you shall come and if not I want to have you write how clocks sell
in that part of the country and how you will do if I will send out some
running parts and you case them. I can get some parts for my work this
spring or some already finished off but I did not know which would be
the best way to send the parts or send them finished and I want to have
you write and let me know which would be the best way for I am a
thinking some about coming out there next fall if I can send some
clocks out there and have you sell them for me and pay you
for the trouble of selling them for I think there is something to be
made on them. Clocks are in good demand here and they are a doing a
good deal at them now. I can buy them for four dollars apiece and if
you think you can sell them
so as to make any thing on them I should like to send some out to you
and have you sell them and I will come out next fall and see you and
see if we cannot get something for ourselves some time or other and not
always be so poor that we cant go alone.<br>
If you had any notion about coming back to this country and wanted to
know any thing about work here, I can tell you that clocks are in good
demand and you could get work any where you was a mind to and get good
wages. There is a young man lives about one mile from me that works at
clocks all the time. He busy the running parts and cases them himself
and makes money by it. He told me the other day that he was drove to
death for clocks. He said he could not finish off as fast as they
wanted them. If I come out there next fall I shall continue to get a
pair of trunks and get them filled with goods and peddle out there and
back again so I need not lose my journey and go for nothing. If you
calculate to come back this spring I want to have you write to me
immediately and write just as you mean to do so I can make calculations
about the clocks. I have wrote about that all I want to so I will write
about something else. We are all well but not much to do this winter
for the snow in this part of the country is three feet deep on the
level and people cannot get about much to bring any work for me to do
but I have got provisions enough to last my family through this winter
if I do not do any thing. Fathers family are well and the Old man
enjoys himself pretty well. Harvey lives in Waterbury and works in the
Button factory and haves nineteen dollars and a half a month and bids
fair to make a smart likely man. He works steady and faithful
and they like him very much and would not let him go away on no
consideration at all. as it respects your fathers family I do not know
any thing about them only I heard from Ebrun's folks last fall and they
were all sick at that time and I have not heard any thing from them
since. I want to have you write how you think german silver spoons will
go out there for if I come out there next fall I intend to bring some
if you think I can sell them to make any profit on them. I can buy them
here for two dollars and a quarter a doze, and I want to have you write
whether I can make any thing or not. <br>
Now I will tell you what I want to have you do, I want to have you if
you will come down to this country and go to work at clocks and I will
go to work with you. We can make the cases and buy the running parts
and finish them off in good style and we can make money on them. We can
hire a shop here where I live. There is a good water wheel and water
enough and right on the turnpike from Woolcottsville to Waterbury and
wood plenty and a large house and a good one and can make bedsteads and
some cabinet if we are a mind to.<br>
I do not know but you will think that I have wrote enough of this
foolish stuff but I write just as I think for I do believe we might do
well. I want to have you consider this and then make up your mind and
then write me an answer, Amen, <br>
I.W.R.<br>
Give our respects all enquiring friends.<br>
I should like to see you all, but the lord only knows when.<br>
I remain your sincere friend and Brother,<br>
Isaac W. Riggs<br>

      <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Dear Brother and Sister,</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">I have been negligent for
reasons I know not what but I have had trouble upon trouble heaped upon
me until it seems as though I didn't know what to do with myself but I
am alive yet and kicking. I have a great deal to say to you but I don't
know where to begin or what to say first. I suppose however that you
would like to hear the particulars concerning Fathers and Isaacs death
and also uncle Josiah Rigby and his wife and Laura Upson, uncle John
Rigbys youngest daughter making five in all of our relatives that have
died within two years. Father the first and Laura the last being about
two years difference in their deaths.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Fathers health was better
after he came back from the west but he had several severe fits of
sickness and got diseased all over so that he was completely broke to
pieces and finally died of disease of the heart. He was very much
distressed in the last stages of life and lay in a dying state about
three hours and I presume a person could have heard him breathe a </span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">doz rods from the house.
Esther you can think what my feelings were but you can't know them
neither can I tell you and then to be taken immediately from that to
the whole care of Isaac on a bed of sickness of six months duration and
then to be separated from him was seemingly more than I could bear for
sometimes it seemed as though I should sink into the earth the
circumstances that Isaac's sickness placed him in was a sourse of grief
to him and I think aggravated his disease for such work as some folks
tried to make was enough to break the heart of a stone and I had them
all to fight but I got through with it and they didn't get him to the
poor house either. Isaac says in his last hours, I thank God I have one
brother that is a brother. The </span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">town of Oxford took Edward
and put him out and Ann took charge of Eliza and I haven't heard direct
from them in over a year. Isaac's disease terminated in consumption, he
died very easy and reconciled compared with what he had to undergo.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Uncle Josiah Ribgy and his
wife both died last summer of dysentery just a weeks difference in
their deaths and Laura died this spring of consumption. I have no near
relatives near me now except Williams and his family and they live up
in Guntown, so</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">called. Eliza was at my
house a few days since she said they were all well as usual. William
grows old but about the same old six pence they have six children and
in rather embarrassed circumstances but however they get along very
well and get a very good living I believe. William keeps out of debt
and that is certainly a good thing for any man but as for ourselves we
are about as good as two and sixpence have young ones as fast as
rabbits and that is about all we do have only we have to work prodigous
hard to take care of them we have got two already and before you know
it we shall have more. We are </span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">going to have a great time
here the fourth and I wish you was here to enjoy it with us also the
advantages of the salt water that we can have but we don't improve it
very often. </span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">I work in Waterbury last
year six or seven months on a hours for Philo Brown Esq. The joiner
work cost between seven and eight thousand dollars. You would hardly
know you was to go to Waterbury now, you stand on west side hill and
look on to it and it looks like a city. I was past the place that used
to be our home last summer and my feelings were better felt than
described. the place looked very natural but our friends I thought
where are they. the thought was too much for me. Only one </span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">brother left with me, both
sisters absent from me, Father, mother and three brothers gone the way
of all the earth, us respecting our stepmother. I believe she took very
good care of Father when he was sick but aside from that I haven't much
to say for her therefore I wont say anything about her. She caused
Father a great deal of trouble say nothing about myself and then to get
rid of her I gave her every thing that belonged to Father that she and
her daughter hadn't stole, she and her son in law agreeing to pay what
few debts there were but I have since had five dollars to pay that
belonged to them to pay, but enough of this for I don't want to think
of it at all. I have had so much trouble and some sickness that my
constitution is pretty much broken down but my health appears to be
rather better this summer than usual. Thus far Harriet's health is not
very good for her although she is never very rugged.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">I work at joinering here
and can get a very good living but that is about all although wages are
$1.50 per day yet every thing is so high here that it takes most of
about all I can earn to live. I believe I have nothing more of
importance to write only I wish you to write to me as soon as you
receive this and write all about your affairs how you get along and all
about Elizabeth and her husband and all about the children. Our
children's names are Georgianna, Amelia, Grace and Ella. </span><span
