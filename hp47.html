<blockquote><big>&nbsp; <a name="id2637"></a>General
David Wooster was born on March 2, 1710-11 to Captain Abraham
Wooster and his wife Mary. He was born at Oronoque in Stratford. About
1719, when David would have been eight or nine years old, the family
removed to the Quaker Farms area in what is now Oxford. His family
occupied a building known as the Mansion House. It was located near
Munson's Corners and sold to Samuel Wooster, Jr., with a farm and saw
mill, in 1733. At that time David Wooster would have been about
twenty-two years of age. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the fact that David Wooster graduated
from Yale in 1738, it would appear that most of his life prior to
attending the college in New Haven, was spent in the Quaker Farms area
in Oxford. The year after he graduated he joined the provincial army.
In 1745 he was a captain under Colonel Burr at the capture of
Louisburg. Later in the French War, he was commissioned colonel and
later brigadier of the colonial militia. After the war he went into
business at New Haven. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wooster also had an opportunity to visit Europe as a
result of the French War. He was given the responsibility of a cartel
ship bound for France and England. He was not allowed to land in
France, but received a friendly reception in England. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was presented to the King and is said to have
been a favorite of the court and of the people. He was given a
captaincy in the English regiments, with half pay for life. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning to New Haven, he became the Royal
Collector of Customs at the Port of New Haven, which provided
further income in addition to his captaincy and his merchantile
efforts. However, his business began to fail, and he was in financial
difficulties at the outbreak of the American Revolution. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sixty-five years old when the Revolution got
underway. He was appointed Major General of six Connecticut troops in
1775 and recruited from the New Haven County areas. He marched these
men to New York and encamped at Harlem. During the summer he also
commanded troops on Long Island, whose duties were mainly guarding the
livestock. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was some trouble concerning promotions by the
Continental Congress when it began to commission Generals. Wooster was
named a brigadier General and some of his junior officers were given a
higher rank. He was especially</big></blockquote>
