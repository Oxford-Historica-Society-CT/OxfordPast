  <big> </big>
  <p class="western"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Welcome
to this site! Here you will find a roster of Oxford citizens
that fought for the Union in the Civil War. I do not claim that this
list is entirely accurate, as there may be errors and omissions. My
main sources have been the &#8220;Record of Service of Connecticut Men in the
Army and Navy of the United States During the War of the Rebellion,&#8221;
published by the state in 1889, along with Blaikie Hines&#8217; &#8220;Civil War
Volunteer Sons
of Connecticut,&#8221; published in 2002. The separate regimental histories
and tid-bits found in the official records of the war add some color,
too.</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Naturally,
people will wonder how this compares to Litchfield and
Hoyt&#8217;s &#8220;History of the Town of Oxford Connecticut.&#8221; Litchfield and Hoyt
acknowledge that their data came from Orcutt&#8217;s earlier &#8220;History of the
Old Town of Derby.&#8221; Orcutt&#8217;s list has seven additional names, and is
missing eight
others found in the state register. Checking the additional seven, they
are not listed by the state as either from Oxford or Derby. </big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>If
you notice errors, please bring them to my attention, and I will be
delighted to make the corrections. Also, if you have anything else to
add, please contact me. Just a note of caution! Please have some
documentation handy if you want to see something corrected. You might
have a story in the family that &#8220;granddad said that great-granddad
said,&#8221; but without some kind of proof, that is all it is: just a good
story.</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>On
the other hand, this site will be updated as the opportunity allows, so
we would LOVE to add any primary documents (diaries, letters, and
pension records) to the collection here. History is alive, and so were
these men. They were not made of marble, like we see in statues. They
were somebody&#8217;s husband, father, son, brother, or uncle. The more we
can
find about them, the more human they become (again). Hines credits
Oxford
with supplying 107 men to the army for the war effort.</big></p>

  </big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>You
might
have noticed that the title of this section does not refer to the
&#8220;Civil War.&#8221;
This seems to be a relatively modern term, though President Lincoln
called
it just that in his Gettysburg Address. Another tongue-in-cheek term is
the
&#8220;Late Unpleasantness.&#8221; Down South, people still refer to it today as
the
&#8220;War of Northern Aggression.&#8221; Looking at documents and statues on town
greens
up here, you can see that veterans were not ambivalent about their
feelings:
it was the &#8220;War of the Rebellion.&#8221;</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>The
actual
listing is by unit and the date it was organized, not necessarily by
the
unit&#8217;s chronological number. There were training camps scattered
throughout the state, and sometimes a higher numbered regiment filled
its quota before a lower numbered unit.</big></p>

  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big><br>

  <big> </big>
  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Like
other northern states, Connecticut&#8217;s response to Lincoln&#8217;s call
for troops in April of 1861 to serve for three months was very
enthusiastic. The government wanted Connecticut to furnish one infantry
regiment;
Governor Buckingham sent three. These fought at Bull Run in July of
1861. No Oxford resident served in them. A fourth regiment was ready
to go, but it was held back, and re-organized as heavy artillery.
Later,
another call for troops came in May. These were to serve for three
years,
and many units not ready for the first call started to re-organize now.
These three-year regiments mustered into service from July of 1861 to
September
of 1862. </big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Many
of these three-year regiments became known as &#8220;veteran volunteer&#8221;
regiments. The soldiers serving in them were proud of this, because in
order to earn the title, a soldier had to re-enlist at the end of his
term, and agree to serve until the war&#8217;s end. Many did so out of
a grim determination developed while in service. They read and heard
of the &#8220;slackers&#8221; and &#8220;Copperheads&#8221; back home, which were not as solid
of conviction as those already serving. The Veteran Volunteers felt
that the only way the war would be won, was by having those already
there
finish the job. Unfortunately, some of them never came home to enjoy
the fruits of victory.</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>In
August of 1862, the president once again called for more troops. These
men were to serve for nine months. The reasoning was that many men
might be willing to volunteer after the haying season, serve their
time, and be home before the next year&#8217;s harvest was due. Connecticut
responded with seven infantry regiments. Either all willing Oxford men
were already serving, or the idea was not popular. Only one Oxford man
volunteered during this time.</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Finally,
beginning in early 1864, Connecticut sent one complete
regiment,
and two partial units composed of black soldiers. Led by white
officers, these &#8220;colored&#8221; units contained free black men and escaped
slaves.
Company B of the 29<sup>th</sup> (Colored) Regiment, Connecticut
Volunteer Infantry listed two men from Oxford. We are conducting
research to verify
that these men were Oxford residents. Some men, white or black, would
list the town they happened to be passing through on their enlistment
papers.</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big><br>

  <big> </big>
  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Hines
asserts that 107 men listed Oxford as their hometown. I verified
106. We have the names, and now we are trying to confirm that they
were citizens, for however long it might have been. The men are listed
here by unit, and then alphabetically by company. You might see men
with the same surname listed apart, as they might have been in
different
companies.</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>The
1889 register lists, in shorthand, the significant events of a
soldier&#8217;s
career. The laconic descriptions often beg further explanation; those
of
you with good imaginations, a quick eye for detail, and a little
knowledge
of the Civil War can probably piece together a thumbnail sketch of some
soldiers&#8217; enlistments. &#8220;MO&#8221; (mustered out) is probably the happiest
remark about a soldier. It means that he served to the end of his term
and was free to go whither he may. Others were less fortunate, and
&#8220;DISC. DIS.&#8221;
Means they were discharged because of disability. Either they got sick,
or received some injury, and could not complete their terms. Some men
were &#8220;PRO&#8221; (promoted in rank); others were &#8220;TRANS&#8221; (transferred) to
another unit. There were those who were &#8220;WD&#8221; (wounded), and others paid
the ultimate sacrifice in battle, denoted by &#8220;KILLED.&#8221; </big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p class="western"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Sadly,
there were men that did not come home because they died in
service, but were not killed in battle. Again, their fates scream for
explanation. &#8220;DIED&#8221; could mean a man perished from disease, by
accident, or murder. Another battlefield fate was being &#8220;CAP&#8217;D&#8221;
(captured). Many of these men were subsequently &#8220;PAR&#8221; (paroled),
meaning that they probably were transferred to a holding camp, awaiting
release because of exchange. A
small number of men did not enlist at the first call, but came in later
as a &#8220;SUB/DRAFTEE&#8221; (substitute or draftee). A substitute was hired to
take someone&#8217;s place, and being a draftee is self-explanatory. The
veteran soldiers usually held these men in contempt. Arguably, the
ultimate disgrace was to be listed as &#8220;DES&#8221; (deserted). A close look
shows that many SUB/DRAFTEE soldiers quickly became &#8220;DES.&#8221; They were
among those who decided to leave the army on their own will; perhaps
research will show if they got bad news from home, saw enough horror on
the battlefield, or were just bored by army life!</big></p>

 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"><big>Be
a detective as you scan through the listings! Use your imagination to
bring these men to life again. Consider Parker Ramsdell, George Riggs,
and Edwin Stuart of Co. B, 20<sup>th</sup> Connecticut. These three
were among the many to have fought at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.
Along with Sherman, they went &#8220;Marching through Georgia,&#8221; whipped the
Rebels through the Carolinas, and finally marched in triumph in the
Grand
Review in Washington D.C. before they went home. What sights did they
see? What hardships did they endure? Emile Le Roy of Company C, 11<sup>th</sup>
Connecticut, was one of two Oxford men who died in the notorious
Andersonville
Prison in Georgia. How was he captured? What were his final days like
in
captivity? Did he have friends near? Were his last thoughts of family
left
behind? George Martin of Company I, 6<sup>th</sup> Connecticut, decided
not to re-enlist as a veteran volunteer. Instead, he took his
well-deserved discharge in September 1864. Did he have enough of the
army? Was home a stronger draw than his friends in Company I? What
about John Smith of the 11<sup>th</sup> Connecticut, Company F? A
draftee who joined the unit in November of 1864, he deserted in April
of 1865. Was &#8220;John Smith&#8221; his real name? Where did he go? Better still,
why did he desert? The amount of time between his enlistment and
desertion suggests that he was not a &#8220;bounty jumper.&#8221; Did he regret it?</big></p>
