        <p style="text-align: left;"><big>regiment of Lobsterbacks (as
            we
            called the British in those days). When each Saturday's
            training
            session came to a close, many of the men, accompanied by
            their wives,
            would join in a social gathering. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ladies brought specially baked muster
            bread
            (like modern day ginger bread, but much tougher), and the
            men always
            seemed to find an adequate source of liquid refreshment. We
            were very
            formal in those days, and we used big words to describe very
            common
            events. The late Saturday afternoon gathering (which today
            we would
            call a party) was a post-muster jollification. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of all my dreams of fighting the
            British
            under the command of Washington, my part in the war was not
            quite so
            glamorous. One evening, in March of 1780, I was returning
            home after a
            visit to the home of a young lady who had struck my fancy. I
            lived at
            the northern boundary of Oxford (where Towantic Hill Road is
            now
            located). In those days it was called Gunntown. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my way home that evening, I came
            across a group
            of men who insisted that I accompany them to an unknown
            destination.
            Some time later I learned that they were British supporters
            who had
            burglarized the home of an American Revolutionary
            sympathizer in
            Bethany. Being afraid that I would recognize them, they took
            me
            hostage. During the next several days of my captivity, I
            learned the
            details of their plot. They had originally met to plan their
            deed at
            Whittemore's Tavern (which still stands in Seymour). Their
            plan was to
            steal large amounts of money and silk goods and turn them
            over to the
            British in Long Island. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I unexpectedly met them on their
            route of
            escape, their scheme came to an abrupt end, and their stolen
            goods were
            quickly discarded. At that point, their only concern was to
            escape from
            this region to the safety of British territory. In order to
            prevent me
            from identifying them to the authorities, they took me with
            them. For
            over a day we hid in a narrow cleft in the rocks to the
            south of
            Gunntown Road (Towantic Hill Road) and then under cover of
            darkness I
            was dragged along Riggs Street until we reached the home of
            the cousin
            of one of the robbers. It was called Captain John Wooster's
            Tavern and
            was located at the falls near the corner of Park Road and
            the main road
            leading to Derby. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stayed there overnight, and I knew
            from the
            frightened actions of my captors that the militia of Bethany
            and Oxford
            were probably in pursuit of them. The next day, in the
            middle of a
            blinding snowstorm, they took me over Great Hill towards
            Derby Landing,
            and then, by boat we traveled down the Housatonic River,
            past Stratford
            and across Long Island Sound to British territory. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't know it at the time, but the
            alarm had
            indeed been sounded in Bethany, Oxford and Derby. Observers
            who were
            sympathetic to the American cause had watched us as we rowed
            past the
            Stratford lighthouse, and by means of telescopes were able
            to determine
            exactly where we had landed on Long Island. Within a matter
            of hours, a
            rescue party was</big></p>
