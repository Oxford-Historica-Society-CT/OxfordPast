This view of a construction bridge with a steam crane was shot from
Stevenson, looking toward Oxford. When construction started in 1917,
the Housatonic River meandered through the boundary between Oxford and
Monroe, but two years later a large lake increased the water level by
76 feet, creating Lake Zoar, which holds about nine billion gallons of
water. (Courtesy of Joseph Lenahan.) (From Images of America, Oxford,
