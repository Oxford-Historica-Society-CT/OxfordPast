Steel for the Spillway bride, June 25, 1958.&nbsp; Photo shows the
change that will be made from the older sharp approach to the bridge.
The power station on the Monroe side of the bridge is in the
background. To the far right you can see the sheet piling which held
the waters back while the Taintor Gates were being constructed. (Photo
