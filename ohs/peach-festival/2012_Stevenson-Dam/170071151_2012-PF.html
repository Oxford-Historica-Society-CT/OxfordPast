Members of the Oxford Ambulance Association pose in 1971 with the
ambulance at the Riverside Fire House.&nbsp; In that year the
association got a second ambu- lance. The ambulance that was previously
based in the Center Fire House was retained and transferred to
Riverside to provide expanded and more rapid ser- vices. The man second
from the left is Franklyn J. Sanford one of the organizers of the
association in 1954 and the Association's first secretary. (Courtesy
