The original Riverside Cemetery was located next to the old church, and
although the site is now under Lake Zoar, all the coffins and stones
were preserved in the new Riverside Cemetery. Notice the railed fence,
which can also be seen in the above picture towards the left of the
photo. (Courtesy of Joseph Lenahan.) (From Images of America, Oxford,
