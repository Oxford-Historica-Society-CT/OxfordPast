Many people gathered at the Stevenson Dam, on March 10, 1935, to view
the water. More water poured over it then than at any time in its
previous history. Torrents of water plunged over the huge spillway,
sending up clouds of mist and spray.&nbsp; Notice the cars and
spectators on the bridge. (Photo from Oxford Historical Society
