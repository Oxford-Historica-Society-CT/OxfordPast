C. W. Blakeslee work in initial construction of the Stevenson
Dam.&nbsp; Both the Oxford and Monroe side of the dam have been
constructed, but the center portion is still open.&nbsp; The structural
work in the foreground is on the Monroe side. The two stacks on the
right are also seen from another perspective in the photo of the Mixing
and Power plants. We would appreciate information about the de- tails
of the photo in order to write a more complete photo caption to keep on
file with the photo.&nbsp; (Photo Courtesy of Monroe Historical Society)<br>&nbsp;<!-- It will appear below the picture -->
