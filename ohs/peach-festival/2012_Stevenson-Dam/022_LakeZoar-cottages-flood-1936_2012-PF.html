<!-- Put your own image description between these markers -->The Floods
of 1936 along the Housatonic and at Lake Zoar damaged many cottages.
The March 13, 1936 flood&nbsp; was one of the most severe in Oxford
history. 25 Cottages that stood on a point in the Housatonic were
destroyed. (Oxford Historical Society Photo, courtesy of Mrs. Arthur P.
