The Zoar Bridge, built by Oxford and Monroe in 1876, was made of
wrought iron and of the suspension type because several previous
bridges had been taken down river by ice freshets. The bridge was used
until 1918 when the Stevenson dam and bridge were built. The old bridge
was about a mile and a half upstream and was flooded by Lake
Zoar.&nbsp; (Courtesy of Sandy Davis.) (From Images of America, Oxford,
