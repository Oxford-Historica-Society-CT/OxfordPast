Pleasant Vale Church was built as a community church. When the power
company wanted to construct the Stevenson Dam, it built the
congregation a new church on Freeman Road, later known as Riverside
Methodist Church, now as Riverside Community Church. The power company
also moved the cemetery -- stones and coffins -- to the new site as
well.
