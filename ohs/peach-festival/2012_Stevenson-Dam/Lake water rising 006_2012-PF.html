1918-19 photo taken of original Stevenson Dam Construction, from the
Monroe Historical Society. As the water in the lake rises against the
dam, the Connecticut Light and Power Company is preparing to start the
new power generation plant. We would appreciate information about the
details of the photo in order to write a more complete photo caption to
keep on file with the photo.&nbsp; (Photo Courtesy of Monroe Historical
