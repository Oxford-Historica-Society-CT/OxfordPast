<!-- Put your own image description between these markers -->This early postcard says "View of Lake at Stevenson, Conn." The naming
of the lake formed by the Stevenson Dam was a subject of controversy.&nbsp;
With a variety of suggested names, the State Legislature declined to
get involved in naming the lake.&nbsp; See Hartford Courant news articles of
Feb, 8, 1923, May 25, 1923, April 8, 1924, and April 21, 1924.
