scenic view of Lake Zoar after the construction of the dam and the
bridge across it, shows a couple by the fence enjoying the view of the
serene lake and countryside. The lake is approximately ten miles long,
with a shoreline of 27 miles, offering summer and winter recreation, as
well as the source of electrical power. (Courtesy of Ann Hunihan
