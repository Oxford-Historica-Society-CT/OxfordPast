Pleasant Vale Church was built as a community church. When the power
company wanted to construct the Stevenson Dam, it built the
congregation a new church on Freeman Road, later known as Riverside
Methodist Church. The power company also moved the cemetery -- stones
and coffins -- to the new site as well. (Courtesy of Mr. and Mrs.
Bernard Lintzner.) (From Images of America, Oxford, by Dorothy A.
