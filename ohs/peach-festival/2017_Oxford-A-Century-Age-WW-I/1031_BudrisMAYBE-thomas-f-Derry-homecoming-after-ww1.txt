1031_Budris:An unidentified World War I soldier receives a jubilant welcome by family and friends at the Derry home on Jack's Hill Road.  Note the star on the front door, and the pair of men waving the flag overhead.  World War I was billed as the Great War, and the "War to End All War."  This optimistic view of future history proved unwarranted in later generations.  This photo, unfortunately, does not have any notation to indicate the names of the people.
