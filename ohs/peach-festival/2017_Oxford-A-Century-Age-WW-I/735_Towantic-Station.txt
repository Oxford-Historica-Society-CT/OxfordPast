735_Towantic-Station

Oxford's railroad station (above) in the Towantic Hill area north of Riggs Street was called Towantic Station. This photo was taken after the construction of the Stevenson Dam - notice electric poles in front of station. Note the telegraph pole in the rear -- there was a line of these poles that stretched across Oxford to reach the railroad station. (Photo from Oxford Historical Society Collection.)
