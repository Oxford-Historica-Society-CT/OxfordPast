When the Cavalry Came to Oxford
August, 1912

The War Games of August 1912 were among the largest ever held on the east coast. The "Red Army" group from the 10th Calvary encamped in the meadow at 53 Great Hill Road, the home of S. B. Church, known as Oxfordshire. Hundreds of tents were spread over the landscape, attracting many onlookers.

The photos show horse and mule-drawn supply wagons moving up and down Governor's HIll Road. Many sightseers and photographers gathered along the sides of the road to see the military maneuvers practiced by the cavalry. The final post card, entitled "Retreat of the Pack Train," shows Zoar Bridge in the background, with another series of supply wagons crossing the river.
