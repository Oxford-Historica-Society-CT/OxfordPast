The Pleasant Vale Church was built as a community church.  When the power company wanted to construct the Stevenson Dam, it built the congregation a new church on Freeman Road, later known as Riverside Methodist Church, now a community church.  The power company also moved the cemetery -- stones and coffins -- to the new site as well.
