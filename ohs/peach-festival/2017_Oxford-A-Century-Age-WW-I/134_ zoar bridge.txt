134 Zoar Bridge: This photo shows the bridge between Oxford and Monroe that was submerged into Lake Zoar upon the filling of the lake. The photo is from the Litchfield-Hoyt History of Oxford, Connecticut. It shows the bridge during an ice freshet, when blocks of ice came from up river and jammed at the base of the dam. Previous versions of the dam collapsed from these spring freshests. The old Post Office and Store is in the background.
