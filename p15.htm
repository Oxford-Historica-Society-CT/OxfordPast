        <blockquote>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><big>the people aspired to become
              a
              town. It was then they preferred their petition to the
              General Assembly
              for incorporation as such. Year after year, to the
              seventh, they
              presented their petition, when on the seventh they were
              successful, and
              Oxford was incorporated a town. Not in the least daunted
              for being six
              times repulsed, they persevered until victory crowned
              their efforts.
              Their indomitable determination, their energetic action,
              their
              unfaltering perseverance, are to be regarded with admiring
              approbation.
              When speaking of this with one who was active in the
              cause, I said,
              "How long were you in gaining success by prevailing with
              your
              petition?" He said, "Seven years; just as long as it took
              our country
              to gain her independence." <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must not omit to say, the people at
              last resorted
              to strategy, and by strategy they succeeded. The town
              election of the
              town of Derby was at hand, The town meeting was warned to
              be held at
              nine o'clock forenoon, but never opened till one o'clock
              afternoon. The
              people of Oxford agreed to go together in a body, and be
              on hand and
              open the meeting of the town at 9 o'clock a.m. It was
              carried out to
              the letter. The hour of meeting was set and known to every
              man who
              might vote. They all congregated and formed in procession
              on the main
              street of the central part, and ready at a given signal
              simultaneously
              to start. The signal given, the procession moved. It was
              so much the
              custom then to open a town meeting with a prayer, that
              proceedings
              without prayer were hardly regarded as legitimate. To save
              trouble from
              that direction, Rev. Wm. Bronson, minister here, was taken
              along to
              offer the opening prayer. The signal for a move being
              given, the
              procession moved on; no time was lost. They reached the
              place of
              meeting. It was nine o'clock. They set about the business
              of the hour
              with a diligence that told what was meant. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Derby people were in consternation.
              They started
              out and ran their horses in every direction, calling on
              persons to
              hasten to the meeting. But before enough of the voters
              could be gotten
              there to outnumber the Oxford voters, <a name="id5220"></a>Nathan
Stiles,
              who resided where
              Dr. Thomas Stoddard now resides in the town of Seymour,
              was chosen Town
              Clerk, and the meeting had voted that town meetings should
              be holden
              one half the time in Oxford. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derby no longer opposed the movement of
              Oxford to
              become a separate town, but turned over and aided in the
              matter. These
              facts were given me by Capt. David McEwen, a prominent
              citizen, one
              ever ready and active in public enterprise, a man of
              laudable
              character, a farmer by avocation, and when in the prime of
              life was one
              of the most thorough, flourishing and successful
              operators. I am told
              he was marshal of the day and led the procession. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In and by the act of incorporation, it
              was ordered
              that the first town meeting be held on the third Tuesday
              of November,
              1798, that&nbsp;<a name="id73"></a>Thomas
              Clark, Esq., warned the meeting, and that</big></p>
