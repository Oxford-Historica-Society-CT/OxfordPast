Nylon parachutes have been dropping from the skies around Hartford, Conn., for some time, but they's always been tested with dummies. On June 6 for the first time ever a nylon 'chute carried a human being to earth -- and a girl at that. She was 24-year-old Adeline Gray, a parachute rigger at the Pioneer Parachute Co., a veteran of 32 test jumps, and a blonde as pretty as the dummies were plain. Asked how the nylon 'chute worked in its first "live" test and how she felt after the 2,000 foot jump, she's only comment "all right." Her employers were not so reticent. They say as much progress has been made in nylon 'chutes in two years as were made in silk 'chutes in twenty and predicted nylon as standard material henceforth because it works "better than silk and is cheaper."
