TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO: June 
The Pioneer Parachute Co., Manchester staged the first "live" jump with the world's first parachute made of nylon this morning at Brainard Field, Hartford, climaxing long and intensive research for a parachute cloth to replace silk. The jump was made by Adeline Gray, 24, of Oxford, first woman parachute rigger employed at Pioneer and the only girl jumper licensed in Connecticut.
