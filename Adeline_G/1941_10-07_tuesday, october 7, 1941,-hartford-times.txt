Lady Parachute Jumper to Aid Regal Theater

Connecticut's only licensed woman parachute-jumper is among the scores who are taking an interest in the picture, "Parachute Battalion," which opens at the Regal tomorrow...

Adeline Gray is the young lady's name. She spends her days packing parachutes at the Pioneer Parachute plant in Manchester, and on weekends earns "pin money" making exhibition jumps. Sunday she landed in a tree and suffered a "black eye," but expects to be on hand to see the picture at the Regal on the opening day.

The film, starring Robert Preston, Nancy Kelly, Edmond O'Brien and Harry Carey with Buddy Ebsen, Paul Kelly, Richard Cromwell and Robert Barrat was produced by Howard Benedict from a screen play by John Twist and Major High Fite of the U.S. Army Air Corps.

Miss Gray's attention was called to the picture by Frank Moran, Regal manager and Harry Reiners, RKO public relations representative who has spent several days in Hartford arranging details for the showing.
