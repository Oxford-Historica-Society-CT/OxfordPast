Reports More Interest in Airport Work

Two More Students Make Solo Flights at Barrington

GREAT BARRINGTON -- Gus Graf, manager and pilot at the Great Barrington airport, reports an increase in aviation interest. His student enrollment this season is the largest ever. Of this group two made solo flights within the last ten days. They are Frank Rossie of theEgremont Road and Phillip B. Allen of Lakeville, Conn. The latter soloed and earned his student permit in three weeks. Graf has another half dozen who will be ready to solo within two weeks.

The manager states he is to revive his parachute jumping, probably next Sunday, in view of the interest that was created last season. He hopes this year to have a girl, Adeline Gray, of Oxford, Conn., jump for exhibition purposes. Graf is also contemplating training those who want to take jumps. Eric Oppenheimer of New York, assistant at the airport last season, will arrive within a few days to assist during Graf's seventh season as manager.

The airport has not been too busy on commercial trips this season, but seven planes are now in the hangar. They include a new training plane, a Lycoming Cub, that Graf brought in from the factory at Lock Haven, Pa.
