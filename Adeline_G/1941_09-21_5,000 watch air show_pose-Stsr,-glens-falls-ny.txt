5,000 Watch Air Show

More than 5,000 persons taking up vantage points varying from a few yards to nearly a mile from Glens Falls Airport, Floyd Bennett Field, yesterday turned their eyes skyward to watch the death-defying antics of the Sky Devils as they presented a full-afternoon air circus.

Expert pilots put on a breath-taking series of dives, square loops, barrel rolls and other difficult manipulations without mishap but Miss Adeline Gray, noted woman parachute jumper was slightly injured when she misjudged the wind and overshot the field, landing in some scrub brush northeast of the airport. A dead stick landing by Larry Baird, who also stalled and cranked the motor of his ship in mid-air, was another feature of the show.

The heavy traffic and policing of the field was handled by State Police, the Warren County Sheriff's Office, Conservation Department officials and members of the Glens Falls Motorcycle Club.
