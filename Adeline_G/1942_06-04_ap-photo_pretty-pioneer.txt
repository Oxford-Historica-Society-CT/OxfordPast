The world's first jump in a parachute manaufactured of nylon fabric was to be made today at Brainard Field, Hartford, Conn. The jumper is Adeline Gray, 24, who was to make her leap from an altitude of 2000 feet. The parachute has been tested by dropping it from planes with a dummy attached for weight, but Miss Brainard  (ERROR IN ORIGINAL-what's the term?) will give it the first trail of the more important kind.
