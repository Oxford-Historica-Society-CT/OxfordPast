Miss Adeline Gray, native of Oxford, only licensed woman parachute jumper in Connecicut, is scheduled to perform as one of the attractions of the Fourth of July program to be presented at Lake Quassapaug, Middlebury, Thursday.

Miss Gray is 21 years old, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Martin Gray of Oxford. Clad in socks, sneakers, skirt and sweater, she seems more like a schol girl than a licensed jumper who is earning her living appearing at air races and carnivals.

She was born in Seymour and attended the Seymour schools, although the family moved to the Oxford farm when she was about two years old. 

During the last three years, Miss Gray has jumped at all the Connecticut fields, at the Cleveland air races last year and this year at Lancaster, Pa.

If the air races are held at Cleveland this year, she is scheduled to do a high solo jump and she will probably give an exhibition at the Danbury fair this fall. What she is really working for, she says, is to better the women's altitude record of 30,000 feet, now held by a woman in Russia.
