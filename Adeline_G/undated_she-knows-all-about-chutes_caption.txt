She Knows All About 'Chutes

 Caption:

Blue-eyed, blonde Adeline Gray, who at 19 was the only woman licensed parachute jumper in Connecticut and, as far as she knows, still is at 25, is head of the repair shop of the Pioneer Parachute Company in Manchester. Here she is inspecting some of the parachutes that have been repaird and are now ready for rigging and packing. She learned about parachutes by using them as a stunt jumper at air shows, and made 34 such jumps.
