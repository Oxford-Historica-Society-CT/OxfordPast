1941_09-11_Evening-Sentinel_OXFORD GIRL WILL LEAP FROM PLANE AT BETHLEHEM FAIR

Miss Adeline Gray Had Narrow Escape in Jump Last Sunday at Bethany Airport.

Miss Adeline Gray, pretty blonde professional parachute jumper. will be the feature attraction at the Bethlehem fair, in Bethlehem, Saturday. She will make her daring exhibition jump from an open cockpit plane, flying at an altitude of 2,600 feet above the fair grounds. As she leaves the plane, she will make a smoke trail while tumbling earthward and then open her parachute to make a landing within the fair grounds.

Miss Gray has made several appearances at the Bethany airport this season and has thrilled thousands with her smoke jumps. Last Sunday's jump at Bethany almost proved fatal to the pretty Oxford miss when an "upstairs wind" carried her swiftly across the field causing her to land between high tension power lines so that she struck one of the power lines. Fortuntely there was no ground contact and she escaped with a few bruises.

After making her appearance at the Bethlehem fair, Miss Gray will leave for Keene, New Hampshire, where she will leap from a 7,000 foot altitude and carry smoke to 1,500 feet at which height she will open her parachute.

Miss Gray is known as the queen of parachutes and is Connecticut's only licensed woman parachutist. She owns her own jumping outfit and recently purchased a new Pioneer jumping outfit. The back pack is a new type chute which has a roll at the shoulders, a style rapidly growing in demand among all fliers.
