Blond 'Chutist

Nylon parachutes have been dropping from the skies around Hartford, Conn., for some time, but they've always been tested with dummies. 

On June 6 for the first time ever a nylon 'chute carried a human being to the earth -- and a girl at that. She was 24-year-old Adeline Gray, a parachute rigger at the Pioneer Parachte Co., a veteran of 32 test jumps, and a blonde as pretty as teh dummies were plain. Asked how the nylon chute worked in its first "live" test and how she felt after the 2,000 foot jump, she'd only comment "all right." 

Her employers were not so reticent. They say as much progress has been made in nylon 'chutes in two years as were made in silk 'shutes in twenty and predicted nylon as standard material because it works "better than silk and is cheaper."
