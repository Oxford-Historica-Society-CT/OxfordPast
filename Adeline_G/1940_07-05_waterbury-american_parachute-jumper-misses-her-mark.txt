A high wind caused Miss Adeline sGray, woman parachute jumper, to land on the state highway in Middlebury instead of on Lake Quassapaug where she was scheduled to land early last evening, as a feature of the park's public amusement. Several thousand persons watched the jump from the plane at a distance of 2,000 feet in the air.
