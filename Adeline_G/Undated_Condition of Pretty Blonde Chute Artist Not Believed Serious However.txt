Condition of Pretty Blonde Chute
Artist Not Believed Se-
rious However.

Miss Adeline Gray, pretty blonde Oxford parachute jumper, is convalescing with a sprained back, an injury attributable to an accident which occurred when she leaped from a plan at Bethany airport Sunday and was carried by the wind into a tree. She was believed at the time to have escaped injury but the back injury disclosed itself later. It is not believed to be of a serious character and Miss Gray hope to be back with the Dutton flying circus in which she is a star performer.

Miss Gray leaped from a plane, 2,600 feet over the Bethany airport and during the 'chute's opening her feet got caught in the shroud lines, whipping her shoes off in midair so that when she was extracated from the tree top by airport attendants there was considerable amusement in the crowd to see her returning to the airport in her stocking feet. Just where her shoes landed no one knows.
