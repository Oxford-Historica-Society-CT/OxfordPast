Oxford Girl Suffers No serious Hurts and Asks for Sandwiches.

Miss Adeline Gray, Oxford girl parachutist, was carried some distance by a high wind after leaping from a plane over the Bethany airport Sunday afternoon and landed in a tree in the woods about 2,500 feet west of the field. Miss Gray suffered no serious injury and asked for sandwishes to be brought to her while airport attendants were busy untangling her chute from teh loft tree in which she was suspended.

Miss Gray planned to make another chute leap this afternoon.

Miss Gray is with the Dutton's Sky Devils Air circus and had another narrow escape recently at Glen Falls, N. Y., when she seffered a severe nose injury.
