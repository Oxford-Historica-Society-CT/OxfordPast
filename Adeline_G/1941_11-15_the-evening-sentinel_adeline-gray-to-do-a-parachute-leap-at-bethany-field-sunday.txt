ADELINE GRAY TO DO A PARACHUTE LEAP AT BETHANY FIELD SUNDAY

Adeline Gray, Oxford girl parachutist, will make another appearance at Bethany airport Sunday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock when she is scheduled to make a parachute jump which was postponed from last Sunday due to the rainy weather. She will perform with two chutes in her descent, a stunt which she has performed only once before at the Bethany airfield.
