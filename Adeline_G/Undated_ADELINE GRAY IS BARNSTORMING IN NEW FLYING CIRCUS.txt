ADELINE GRAY IS BARNSTORMING IN NEW FLYING CIRCUS

Miss Adeline Gray, noted parachute jumper, has joined an air circus now barnstorming the New England states and upper New York State and her next appearance with this how will be at Glen Falls, N. Y., Sunday, September 28. She does a feature act, leaping out of a plan flying at an altitude of 8,000 feet and falling through space at 150 miles an hour before opening her parachute 1,000 feet above the ground. In this delayed drop she carries smoke, leaving a smoke trail from her ship to the altitude at which she opens her 'chute. Carrying smoke is essential in high altitude jumps because otherwise it is impossible for spectators on the ground to see Miss Gray as she leves the ship due to its height. Miss Gray has already made two appearances with this air circus, doing an 8,000 foot leap at Keene, N.H., September 14 and another at Athol, Mass., September 21.
