MISS GRAY TO JUMP AT BETHANY AGAIN SUNDAY

Oxford Girl Suffered Frozen Hands
in Last Sunday's Descent
Through Cold Air.

Miss Adeline Gray, noted girl parachutist, will make another of her daring leaps at Bethany field Sunday at 3:30 p.m. Miss Gray who is Connecticut's only licensed girl parachutist, has given thousands of spectators many thrilling moments at Bethany field in her several appearances this season.

In her leap last Sunday at Bethany from a high altitude the air was so cold that her hands were frozen on the way down so that she was unable to use them to free herself from her parachute and admists that she was on the verge of crying.

Being a licensed parachute packer and rigger she packs her own new Pioneer parachute outfit for all of her exhibition jumping.
