Woman Parchutist to Jump During Air Show at Airport Tomorrow

In the show to be presented by the Sky Devils at the local airport tomorrow, Miss Adeline Gray, noted woman parachute jumper, will be carried aloft to eight thousand feet and then will drop more than half a mile before opening her 'chute. On her downward plunge Miss Gray will leave a smoke trail so that she may be followed as she makes her outstanding delayed drop. So tiny that she can't be seen with the naked eys as she jumps, she uses the smoke to enable the spectators to follow her descent.

Howard Dutton, New England aerobatics flying champion is leader of the Sky Devils.

Miss Gray was given the title of "Parachute Queen" at the Cleveland Air Races in 1939. She is a test jumper for the Pioneer Parachute Company of Manchester, Conn., and the only licensed parachute packer and rigger in that state.

Two weeks ago while jumping for the Sky Devils Adeline was knocked unconscious as her 'chute opened and after regaining consciousness fought fiercely to keep herself from plunging into a high tension power line. However, clever handling of her parachte clipped her by the dangerous wires and she dropped safely to earth and then collapsed.
