Wind Upset Plans To Come Down In Lake; Huge Crowd Watches

An unscheduled landing in the center of thd state highway at Middlebury was made by Miss Adeline Gray, woman parachute jumper early last night. A high wind prevented Miss Gray from landing in the lake at Lake Quassapaug, where she was to be picked up by a speedboat. The wind carried her to the state highway bordering the resort where she landed safely, although she narrowly missed the power lines bordering the road. Her parachute was entangled in a tree at the highway's edge at the completion of her jump.

Miss Gray was flown to the scene in a cabin monoplane which was escorted by five other planes. Several thousand persons witnessed the jump which was made from an altitude of about 2,000 feet.

A native of Oxford, Miss Gray is the only licensed woman parachute jumper in Connecticut. She has made jumps at all the Connecticut fields, at the cleveland air races last year and this year at Lancaster, Pa.

She plans an attempt this year to better the women's altitude record of 30,000 feet, now held by a woman in Russia.
