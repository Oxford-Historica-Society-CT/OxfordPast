1941_11-22_The Evening Sentinel_MISS GRAY THROUGH FOR THE SEASON AT BETHANY AIRPORT

Miss Adeline Gray of Oxford, noted air performer, has concluded her season at the Bethany airport where she made a spectacular leap Thanksgiving day from an altitude of 28,000 feet, scattering turkey feathers in her descent. Because of wind conditions Miss Gray, instead of descending, was carried upward several times and was spinning around like a top as she neared terra firma and finally landed safely across the street from the air field.
