HARTFORD, Conn, June 6 (UP). - The first parachute jump with a nylon 'chute was completed successfully today by blonde Adeline Gray, 24, the only licensed woman parachute jumper in Connecticut.

The parachute was developed by the Pioneer Parchute Co., Man chester, Conn., where Miss Gray is a parachute rigger. She jumped at 2,000 feet, and landed wihtout injury.

She said the parachute worked perfectly and that she fell "all right." Then she went back to work.

J. Floyd Smith, company vice-president, said the substitute material "works better than silk" in chutes, and predicted its  adoption as standard material. He said it is cheaper, too.

Several uniformed officials watched the jump from a plane piloted by Capt. Ted Matusewic. Miss Gray dropped about 150 feet before pulling the cord, and sailed down without mishap.
