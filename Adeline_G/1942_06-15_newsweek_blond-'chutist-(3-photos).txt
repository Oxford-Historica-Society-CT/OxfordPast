Unfavorable conditons for testing forced Adeline Gray, 24 year old Oxford girl parachutist, to postpone until next week the first jump with a nylon parachute which was scheduled for yesterday at Brainard field in Hartford.

Though disappointed by her failure to make the jump Miss Gray is eager to be teh first person to jump with a chute made of nylon rather than the traditional silk.
 
"Jumping affects me like music affects some people," she declared. "I feel so free and good, away from all trouble."

Miss Gray is show in the accompanying photo having her pack adjusted by J. Floyd Smith, designer of the nylon chute, at Hartford. Up to now the designer has been using dummies in his tests.
