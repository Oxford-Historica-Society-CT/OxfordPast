Silk Substitute

Henry R. Mallory, president and treasurer of the Pioneer Company, in announcing the "live jump" test, said taht the concern was searching for a silk substitute for parachutes long before Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. After experiments carried on in conjunction with the Cheney Brothers Company, of Manchester, and the Dupont Company, developers of nylon, a yarn twist and weave was devised that combined compactness with lightness, resilency and strength. The qualities of this new fabric won the approval of J. Floyd Smith, Pioneer vice-president and chief engineer, who invented the first free-type parachute, the basic design of which is now used throughout the world in 1918.

Time schedule for the test was not announced in an effort to avoid confusion and the forming of dangerous crowds, however a complete description of the entire event will be broadcast over Station WTIC at 12:45 p.m.
