TO SCATTER TURKEY FEATHERS IN LEAP FROM PLANE TOMORROW

Miss Adeline Gray, Oxford parachute jumper, will scatter turkey feathers to the winds as she leaps from a plane above the Bethany airport tomorrow afternoon. Bailing out with a supply of feathers from the Thanksgtiving day bird, she will relase them before opening her chute. The leap will take place at whatever hour weather conditions are favorable. Due to high winds last Sunday, Miss Gray was not permitted to jump.
