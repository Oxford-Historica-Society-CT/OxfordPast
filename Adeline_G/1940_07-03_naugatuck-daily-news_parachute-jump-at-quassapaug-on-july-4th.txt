Miss Adeline Gray, native of Oxford, only licensed woman parachute jumper in Connecticut, is scheduled to perform as one of the attractions of the Fourth of July program to be presented at Lake Quassapaug, Middlebury, Thursday.

Miss Gray is 21 years old, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Martin Gray, of Oxford. Clad in socks, sneakers, skirt and sweater, she seems more like a school girl than a licensed jumper who is earning her living appearing in air races and carnivals.

She was born in Seymour and attended the Seymour schools, although the famil moved to the Oxford farm when she was about two years old.

During the last three ears, Miss Gray has jumped at all the Connecticut fields, at the Cleveland air races last year and this year at Lancaster, Pa.

If the air races are held at Cleveland this year, she is scheduled to do a high solo jump and she will probably give an exhibition at the Danbury Fair this fall.
