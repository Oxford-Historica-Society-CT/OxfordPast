Miss Adeline Gray, girl parachutist of Oxford, will be featured at the Bethany Airport tomorrow and Monday, Columbus Day. She will leap from a place at an altitude of 2,600 feet. She will carry smoke as she leaves the plane, making a spectacular sight as she tumbles earthward, finally opening her chute and descending gracefully to earth. Miss Gray is a member of Dutton's Sky Devil's Air Circus and is billed as "The Queen of Parachutes."
