Nola Fern "Lola" MILLER</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Subj: Nola Fern Miller &nbsp;<br>Date: 5/29/2003 9:59:13 PM Central Daylight Time <br>From: JPJingles <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Janice Peay. &nbsp;I am currently researching the Miller line of Longmont, Boulder, CO.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Nola's father, Thomas Clifton Miller, was the son of William Miller and Sarah Jane Debord. &nbsp;He was the second youngest of thirteen children. &nbsp;Do you know anything about him? &nbsp;I found her name posted with Thomas Clifton Miller's name as her father on Ancestry a couple of days ago.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of us Miller researchers, and we have amassed a rather large database. &nbsp;If you are interested, please write. &nbsp;Janice.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Subj: Re: Nola Fern Miller &nbsp;<br>Date: 6/1/2003 11:41:31 AM Central Daylight Time <br>From: JPJingles <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing back! &nbsp;I am in the process of preparing my information for posting to rootsweb. &nbsp;I have a ton of information you need, but decided just to post it to rootsweb. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have information that disagrees with your William Miller, father of Thomas Clifton, information. &nbsp;He was born in Kentucky as was reported in nearly every census. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did you get this information posted below? &nbsp;Did William and this Harriet supposedly divorce, or did she die? &nbsp;If that is the case, where was Lee in all the censuses from 1850 to 1900? &nbsp;Could it be another William Miller, as there are thousands of them? &nbsp;Just checking! &nbsp;I am famous for doubting info until it is verified!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WILLIAM1 MILLER was born 1800 - 1825 in Holland, and died Jan 29, 1898. &nbsp;He married (1) HARRIET (MNU) MILLER-WIFE 1822 - 1865. &nbsp;She was born 1805 - 1828 in Holland.<br>Child of WILLIAM MILLER and HARRIET MILLER-WIFE is:<br>2. i. LEE ALBERT2 MILLER, b. Oct 1847, , PA; d. Feb 16, 1911, Austin, MN.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the next couple of days, today if I can finish in time, I will post to rootsweb. &nbsp;I will also send you a descendancy chart, but there will be more, including all the sources, on rootsweb.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks ever so much for the descendants of Thomas Clifton. &nbsp;Do you know what happened to him, since I haven't been able to find him in a census after 1900? &nbsp;Of course, the 1910 is such a mess. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks again, and if I can answer any questions, please feel free to ask. &nbsp;Janice Peay</p>
