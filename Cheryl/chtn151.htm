Lois HALEY</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Mom d. at 6:00 p.m. on Aug 25, 1999, at &nbsp;Vista Hills Health Care Center in La Crescenta, Los Angeles Co., CA. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her obituary read as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lois Leighton, age 79, loving wife, mother, grandmother and aunt, passed away on Wednesday Aug 25, 1999 after a prolonged respiratory illness. &nbsp;She is survived by her husband of 57 years, Leslie Leighton of Glendale; her son and dau.-in-law Jim and Elizabeth Leighton of San Diego; her grandchildren Aaron and Amy Leighton; her dau. Jeanie Leighton of Glendale; a special family friend Sue Lehman of Glendale; and numerous nieces and nephews. &nbsp;Mrs. Leighton was b. on Feb 19, 1920, in Pauls Valley, OK, and moved to CA with her family in 1934. &nbsp;She has been a resident of Glendale for 58 years. &nbsp;She was a wonderful wife, homemaker, china painter, and loving matriarch who brought pleasure and laughter to family and friends with her gifts of story telling and sense of humor. &nbsp;She is pre-deceased by her sisters Comilla Valentine of Rowland Heights, Cleo Wright of Glendale; and her brother J. F. Haley of Baldwin Park. &nbsp;Grave site services were held on Saturday, Aug 28, 1999, at Grand View memorial Park in Glendale. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eulogy by Jim Leighton, son. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for coming this morning. &nbsp;This is an informal service for Mom and we invite you to say a few words if you desire. &nbsp;Last night I was thinking about what to say and all I could think about was that she was just, "Mom." &nbsp;I thought of one story that reflects on what Mom was like. &nbsp;When I was in junior college, the one thing we did was play cards every Friday evening. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule was that I had to be home by midnight. &nbsp;Because I respected my Mom, I was always home by then. &nbsp;However, on one night I was having a good night and it was 1:15 AM when I left for home. As I was driving home, I was thinking about what to do and say to Mom as well as hoping she wouldn't be up. &nbsp;I had a really nice car, a GTO, which had a little rumble. &nbsp;When I approached the curve in our street I put it in neutral, killed the engine and coasted to the front of our home. &nbsp;The house was dark, but there was enough ambient lighting that I could see into the kitchen and I saw the figure of my mother. &nbsp;I knew I was in for it. &nbsp;When I walked in, the kitchen was still dark. &nbsp;All I said to Mom was that I had a really good night. &nbsp;Mom then turned on the light and she helped me count my money. &nbsp;That was the way Mom was. &nbsp;I will now turn this over to my sister. &nbsp;Please bear with us as she pontificates."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eulogy by Jeanie Leighton, dau. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally had a short outline but I thought &nbsp;what needed to be said, so I expanded a little. &nbsp;As many of you know, Mom had a wonderful sense of humor and loved to tell stories about growing up and being mischievous in OK as well as moving to CA. &nbsp;She could talk for hours and she told of stealing watermelons and not only tipping over outhouses, but moving them back a couple feet so the patrons at night would fall in the hole before they got into the outhouse. &nbsp;She told of not being very fond of one of her uncles so she, her sisters Cleo and Millie and their boyfriends (the Moore boys) cut her uncles' fence and herded the cows into Ponca City and just left them. &nbsp;She had a good time telling the stories and she had a great sense of humor. &nbsp;We had a surprise birthday party for Mom this past year because we didn't want her to get stressed. &nbsp;We waited until the last minute to give her time to get a little more "fixed up." &nbsp;She had a wonderful afternoon. &nbsp;However, when it came time for the birthday cake, she looked at me with her oxygen tube at her nose, and said, "How in the world do you expect me to have enough breath to blow out all of these candles?" &nbsp;She then had my little second cousin sneak her a hairdryer and she blew the candles out with the dryer. &nbsp;Mom could talk. &nbsp;She would go and visit my aunts and stay all morning. &nbsp;She would come home, pick up the phone, and talk to them a couple hours more. &nbsp;She had a gift to have enriching conversations with all whom she met. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom was also beautiful; not only in spirit, but also physically attractive. &nbsp;This was her photo (shown) as a young woman showing the smile that Pepsodent toothpaste paid for and put up on their billboards throughout Los Angeles Co. &nbsp;As I was growing up my friends would tell me how pretty my mom was and I was proud of her. &nbsp;I told her that not too long ago and she started to get teary telling me I had not told her that before. &nbsp;As one gets older it is said that dau.'s begin to resemble their mothers, as I got older I used to laugh about looking like Mom. &nbsp;Now I'm proud to look like her. &nbsp;When Mom started having more serious respiratory problems she went to see Dr. Johnson and asked him how long she had left. &nbsp;He said to her, "Mrs. Leighton, my wife and I have both agreed that you are the most beautiful 78-year-old-woman who has ever come into our office." &nbsp;Mom said, "Oh doctor, you have made my day, but tell me, how many do I have left?" &nbsp;Her sense of humor never failed to enhance her beauty. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom was also a very talented artisan and craftsman. &nbsp;Her china painting was a joy for her and she loved sharing her talents with family and friends. &nbsp;I have one cousin who seems to have acquired a greater share than most of us. &nbsp;She was also a craftsman and helped Dad start his business by building cabinets in the garage. &nbsp;She could fix a watch, and was also adept at fixing a toilet that the plumber couldn't repair. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But above all Mom had a gift of sharing her love. &nbsp;She and Dad had a very special love. &nbsp;They dated only six weeks before they got md. and that mg. lasted 57 years. &nbsp;At the end of the war Mom went to pick up Dad on Brand Boulevard. &nbsp;Only problem was that they ended up on opposite sides of the street. &nbsp;As in the movies they ran to each other and embraced in the middle of the street. &nbsp;The cars all stopped and started honking their horns 'cause they knew Dad had just come home from the war. &nbsp;There isn't a mother who loved her children more. &nbsp;She doted on Jimmy and me. &nbsp;She protected us like a mother lion and she worried about us to a fault. &nbsp;Even as adults, we would have to call her when we arrived at our destination so she would know that we were okay. &nbsp;She definitely had an abundance of "worry" genes. &nbsp;She loved Elizabeth, Jimmy's wife. &nbsp;She loved her so much and knew that she was Jimmy's rock and the love of his life. &nbsp;And she loved A. J. and Amy so much. &nbsp;She spoiled them every time they visited. &nbsp;At the end of their visit she would send them home with "Care Packages" of red "Vines," cookies, and 12-packs of Pepsi. &nbsp;She would also sneak them a little cash without their parents knowing. &nbsp;She also loved her many nieces and nephews. &nbsp;She lived with Auntie Cleo and Uncle B. while Dad was away at war. She grew up with Edith and Sally and loved them as her own children. &nbsp;She was protective and loving for Frances, Ronny, Phillip, Dwayne, Donna, Darrell, and all of the grandnieces and nephews. &nbsp;She held a special place in her heart for Susie who was kicked out of her home one night and came to spend the evening with us. &nbsp;Sue never left 'cause Mom and Dad revealed to her what a loving family was. &nbsp;She so loved our little puppy, Chelsea, who still lies at the side of her chair even after she has left. &nbsp;They had a special little "scratching" ritual and Chelsea knew she was "Gramma's dog." &nbsp;She had a gift of sharing her love with all whom she met. &nbsp;She was a special matriarch who loved and kept her family together. &nbsp;She will always be loved and sorely missed. &nbsp;There are many aspects of my mother's life that has touched us as family, friends, and acquaintances. &nbsp;I now invite you to share your memories of my mother with us now. &nbsp;However, before that, I wish to invite you to join the family at my home at 1647 Kenneth Road following the interment.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eulogy by Elizabeth Leighton, dau.-in-law. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person who cries at Hallmark commercials and hellos at airports, I knew there was no way I would be able to verbally express my feelings, so I am writing my thoughts. &nbsp;From the moment we met 30 years ago Mom took me into her family and heart and I have always felt as if I belonged. &nbsp;Many people make fun of mothers-in-law, but I truly feel she was the best there ever was and I wouldn't have traded her for the world. &nbsp;She knew right away how much I loved her son and accepted me as a part of his life. &nbsp;She never judged me and offered advice only when she knew I wanted it. &nbsp;One of the reasons I fell in love with Jimmy was because of his wonderful sense of humor and his infectious laugh, both of which he got from his mom. &nbsp;I will be eternally grateful for that. &nbsp;Another trait he inherited from her was her theory that if you're going to buy something, always buy the BEST. &nbsp;I'm really grateful for that! &nbsp;(In case you didn't get it, that was a little levity to break the tension). &nbsp;We all know what a wonderful sense of humor she had. &nbsp;No one enjoyed telling a joke more. &nbsp;Many times she would crack up before she got through (or even started) and we would all be hysterical and we wouldn't even know why! &nbsp;I have so many wonderful memories of her but the ones I hold dearest are from around the kitchen table when we would visit on weekends. &nbsp;She and I would sit at the kitchen table for 2 or 3 hours in the morning talking, laughing, and probably crying. &nbsp;She had such a love of conversation. &nbsp;I only had to ask a question and she would talk for 20 or 30 minutes before I had to say anything! &nbsp;I'm sure you all remember food when you think of Lois. &nbsp;Two items stick out in my memory; potato soup and fried potatoes and onions. &nbsp;No one could make them like she could. &nbsp;Amy just reminded me of when she was eating popcorn and drinking hot chocolate in the fold-out bed while watching "The Love Boat." &nbsp;One time she spilled the cocoa and began crying because she thought Gramma would be mad, but Gramma just changed the sheets and made more chocolate. &nbsp;That's how she was. &nbsp;She was the best mother and grandmother and I will have cherished memories forever. &nbsp;I thank her for giving us Jimmy and Jeanie and for being such a warm, caring and loving person. &nbsp;Mom, I love you so much and will miss you terribly. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eulogy by Mary Struzella, family friend. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always think that there is going to be a tomorrow. &nbsp;Tomorrow, I will balance my checkbook, get a new job, start an exercise program, or make a phone call, because today, I am busy doing my job, doing the laundry, chasing the kid, or whatever occupies my time. &nbsp;Thankfully, most of us do get another chance, tomorrow. &nbsp;But, my friend, Auntie Lois, d. without me getting a chance to tell her what she meant to me and how much I cared for her. &nbsp;My tomorrow didn't come before I realized how precious little today I had, let alone tomorrow. &nbsp;Aunt Lois and I played canasta every Monday night for one solid year. &nbsp;she and I were partners against her sister, Cleo, and our friend, Laurie. &nbsp;Every Monday, right after work, we showed up at Aunt Lois' kitchen for an entire Sara Lee coffee cake, a pot of full strength coffee, a pack of smokes between us all, and lots of dirty jokes and laughing and life lessons, and a little card playing. &nbsp;I always knew I was in for one of her lessons when Aunt Lois would start a sentence with "Now Mary, you know that I've been around the tea cup more than a few times." &nbsp;This usually meant that my approval rating was hovering dangerously low and that I had better pay attention to what my friend was saying. &nbsp;For if I did, I would surely avert trouble. &nbsp;With Aunt Lois, things were either black or white, right or wrong, her way or the highway. &nbsp;There was little that could be said to change her mind once she made it up. &nbsp;Now, that isn't to say that Aunt Lois wasn't fiercely protective of those of us lucky enough to be included in her circle of family and friends. &nbsp;She was always the first one to spot "trouble" and get on the phone to "fix" the situation. &nbsp;Pity the person on the other end of her blessing. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always had a pot of coffee, or a sandwich at lunchtime, or a good ear to talk to, whenever you needed it. &nbsp;She expected truthfulness and loyalty in return for the truthfulness and loyalty that she gave you, even if it was painful for you to hear. &nbsp;Life with Aunt Lois wasn't always serious. &nbsp;She would joke with her husband, Les, and delight at the affectionate name, Ouchie, that her granddaughter, Amy, called him. &nbsp;Who didn't know about A. J.'s baseball skills, and what a terrific kid she thought he was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was always quick to share how proud she was of her son, Jim, and dau.-in-law, Beth. &nbsp;I had the impression that Jim single-handedly rebuilt the downtown San Diego area. &nbsp;Beth got the credit for the well-mannered grandchildren. &nbsp;Dau. Jeannie was the most clever girl a mother could ever wish for. &nbsp;Who else could go from PE teacher to Principal, in such a short time. &nbsp;By now, Special Friend, Susie must be the President of Smart and Final. &nbsp;She was as proud of her as if Susie were her own. &nbsp;She seemed to get great pleasure in calling her brother-in-law, Oscar, O. B. &nbsp;I always thought his middle name must start with "B." &nbsp;It did, but she was actually calling him Old Bastard, with lots of love. &nbsp;With Aunt Lois, you knew you were special, otherwise, she just didn't bother with you. &nbsp;Why she would even bake your favorite cake right now, on the spot, and didn't even make you wait to let it cool before you could have your first slice with a glass of milk! &nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt Lois was happiest taking care of her family. &nbsp;She knew the importance of today, and didn't wait until tomorrow to tell you what she thought and, if you listened, how much you meant to her. &nbsp;I always felt loved in the presence of my dear friend, Aunt Lois, and I am hoping that she understands how today got away from me before I could tell her how much I loved her.<br>Genealogy.com (LLC), Broderbund (FTJ), Vol. 50, Tree 1655.</p>
