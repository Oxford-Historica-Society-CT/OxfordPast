Miles Henry BODENNER</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Penzance, Cornwall, England in October 1848 as an infant, having been born on 29 February 1848. &nbsp;His name was Stephen Bodenner and was the son of Henry Bodenner. <br>Matthew William Bodenner Dec 12 2000 isd 40 yrs old -- b. 12 12 1940<br>William Bodenner would be my Grandfather's brother and I believe would be the brother to your Great Grandfather. Henry and Johanna came over from Cornwall in October 1848 when my Grandfather was only a few months old having been born in February of that year. Hope all is well with you two. If we put all our information about the Bodenner family together we might have quite a complete biography.

His birth occurred at Lancaster, Grant county, Wisconsin, May 31, 1861, his parents being Henry and Johanna (Rogers) Bodenner, both of whom were natives of Cornwall, England, and remained residents of that country until after their marriage. Crossing the Atlantic, they settled in Grant county, Wisconsin, where they made permanent location about the year 1855. The father engaged in mining, although he became a landowner, and was active in the lead mines of that vicinity until he met death in the mines in 1863. His widow and the family retained the old home in Grant county until 1880, when they removed to Lac qui Parle county, Minnesota, where the mother remained until her death about the year 1888. William Bodenner is the youngest in a family of nine children. He attended the district schools of Grant county, Wisconsin, and when but eleven years of age began working for others in that county. He was thus employed for eleven years and then removed to Deuel county, South Dakota, where he served an apprenticeship at the harness maker's trade for three years. He was afterward employed by the L. C. Porter Company at carpentering for two seasons and then came to the Black Hills country, settling first at Buffalo Gap, where he engaged in the stock business, continuing there for about eight years. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then disposed of his holdings at that place and removed to Fairburn, where he has since engaged in merchandising, owning a general store, in which he carries a large and attractive line of dry goods, hardware, groceries and other things. The lower floor, sixty by fifty feet, is completely stocked with an attractive line of goods. There was only one store at Fairburn when Mr. Bodenner became connected with the business interests of that place He is also a landowner, having property in his section of the state and is a stockholder in the Dan Patch electric line at Minneapolis, while his wife is a stockholder in the bank at Fairburn. He devotes his entire time to his business interests, concentrating his efforts largely upon the management of his store. In September, 1893, Mr. Bodenner was married to Miss Anna W. Smith, who was born at Elk Point, South Dakota, a daughter of Miles Henry and Lilly (Mitchell) Smith, both of whom were natives of Fredericktown, New Brunswick, Canada. They were married there and after coming to the United States settled in eastern South Dakota, where the father engaged in farming. Later he turned his attention to the machinery and implement business and on removing to Fairburn he established a flour and feed business. Subsequently he went to Buffalo Gap, where he engaged in general merchandising with his son W. M. as a partner. There he remained until his death, which occurred May 22, 1910. He was twice elected to the state legislature and was a prominent and influential citizen of his community. He survived his wife for some time, her death occurring in 1890. Mrs. Bodenner is the youngest of their five children and by her marriage has become the mother of four children. Miles H., who occupies the position of state game warden, resides thirteen miles west of Fairburn. William F. assists his father in the store. Lyle B. and Dotha Belle are both at home. Mr. Bodenner holds membership with the Odd Fellows, the Modern Woodmen of America and the Modern Brotherhood of America. He is loyal to the teachings and purposes of those organizations and his life has been well spent according to modern standards of manhood and citizenship. In business he has qualities that make him an enterprising and reliable merchant and wherever known he is held in high esteem.</p>
