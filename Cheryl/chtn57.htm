<p>LETTER FROM JOHN CHATFIELD TO (his father) ISAAC CHATFIELD, LAFAYETTE STARK CO. ILL &nbsp;&nbsp;DATED APRIL 10, 1849, OREGON CITY, O.T., POSTMARKED SAN FRANCISCO, DATE UNREADABLE<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's River O.T. April 10, 1849<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Father & Mother,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now upwards of two years since I left home and have been unable to hear from or about you until a few weeks since I &nbsp;received a letter from Olive Lake (dated Feb. 1848) which brought me the agreeable news of your good health up to the date of her kind letter. &nbsp;For which very acceptable letter you will please give Miss Olive my thanks and best wishes. &nbsp;Since I left home I have been favored with excellent health, have met with no serious accidents, endured a few hardships, met with some whole sonled fellows, and some to the contrary, but have not made my fortune yet. &nbsp;However, my prospects are at this time somewhat flattering as I am preparing to go to the California Gold Mines, where gold is very easily obtained. &nbsp;As for Oregon I shall only say that it possesses some important advantages, but all the disadvantages of a new country and is at this time thrown into great confusion by the discovery of the Gold Mines. &nbsp;All things considered if I should give my opinion relative to emigrating to this country it would be (for all those that desire to enjoy this life to the best advantage) to stay at home, especially old people.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regard California if the best information &nbsp;I can get of that Country is correct, it is a poor, sickly, sterile country and only valuable for it's gold mines which are very extensive and rich. &nbsp;Gold has even found on all the streams along the Sierra Nevada of California Mountains as far as have been explored, which is from 800 to 1000 miles. &nbsp;And so rich or plenty that it is not very uncommon for a man to obtain $200 worth in a single day and an average days work is said to be from 2 to 4 ounces. &nbsp;I.C. Avery (?) if this place and formerly of Stark County Ill, dug about $1400. in seven days. &nbsp;The above is the fair side of the picture of the Gold mines and I need hardly tell you that there is another side, such as hardships, privations, sickness and the worst of society. &nbsp;There is a tale circulating here about a young man that had been rather an unsuccessful candidate for matrimony among the girls of Oregon who went to the mines and when digging one day had the good fortune to find a 24 pound lump of Gold; &nbsp;After looking at it for a moment he was heard to exclaim a wife now by G_d.__My intention now is to go to the mines this spring, remain there from 12 to 18 months and then return home if my health is spared. <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elmira, widow of the late Parker Ward was married a few day since to Dr Saffron of Oregon City.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the road to Oregon as far as Ft Laramie is very good, but the balance of the way it is as bad as can be and traveled with wagons. &nbsp;The first winter I saw in Oregon was very mild but the second one was so cold as to be rather sever upon the stock as it is never fed in this country--There was considerable snow that laid about three weeks--However the friends of Oregon say it was a very, extraordinary winter but I fear these extraordinarys occur too often. &nbsp;You will give my best wishes to Dr Nan and all inquiring friends and especially much joy to E. McNaught Esq - - -<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Chatfield <p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Chatfield bn 11-11-1825, D Oct. 11,1908 at age 82 yrs 11 month,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was son of Isaac Chatfield and &nbsp;Sabrina Beebe. &nbsp;His sister was Huldah Maria Chatfield, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who married William P. Lake. &nbsp;Olive Lake was daughter of Huldah and William. &nbsp;Olive <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;married Charles Edmund Blakesley. &nbsp;(Hair sample in the file.) &nbsp;Harriet Melissa Lake, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter of Huldah and William, married Stillman Lee, who brother Richard Lee wrote<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Civil War Letters. &nbsp;Harriett and Stillman are the Grand Grandparents of Winnie &nbsp;&nbsp;V. Bryan.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Bible 1869 belonged to Harriet Melissa Lake Lee and contains the &nbsp;name of John<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chatfield and a newspaper article about the death of his sister Polly Chatfield Grant, age <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;91, in Illinois. &nbsp;It says John left the east for the west in 1847, and was the oldest living &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white settler in the Bitter Root valley, which I believe is near Missoula MT.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blakesley's must have gone west also, as Olive and several of her children died in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto, Big Horn, WY.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>This is an entry written by Harry E. Chatfield in his books titled "Two Brothers and Friends, A Chatfield History and Genealogy" &nbsp;(Volume IV). &nbsp;(These are now out of print and I have copies of a few of the volumes). Cheryl (Chatfield) Thompson.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Chatfield, born at Kirtland, Lake, OH, presents a challenge to the genealogist in that there are numerous references to him in historical works, but details such as date of marriage, his wife's first name, and children are lacking. &nbsp;It is known that he left OH on Apr 1, 1847 and shortly thereafter was roaming around the Rocky Mountains of Colorado in the company of mountain men. &nbsp;Several months later he arrived with a bull team at what is now Corvallis, OR, where he became engaged in mining and packing. &nbsp;On Jul 6, 1860 he departed Umatilla, OR for the Bitter Root Valley of Montana where he would live out his final years. &nbsp;He traveled the old Mullen Military Road to Hell Gate (now Missoula), arriving there in July 27. &nbsp;Subsequently, he drifted to Fort Owens where he became a packer under the employ of Major John Owens, and later was that post's first postmaster. &nbsp;It seems also that he was in some way an employee of the Indian Service, for there is a record of his beginning a trip to Fort Lemhi to settle a dispute between the Indians and a packer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Chatfield was one of the earliest settlers of Stevensville, and lived in the vicinity most of his life. &nbsp;An unidentified news clipping called him "kind-hearted and generous, and a veritable bureau of information about the history of the (Bitter Root) valley." &nbsp;The same clipping mentions a wife who died in 1883, and his obituary lists a step-son Robert Barker, which indicates her last name was the same. &nbsp;John Chatfield did at Stevensville, MT on Oct 10, 1908 and is buried at Maplewood Cemetery."</p>
