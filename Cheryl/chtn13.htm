Franklin Pierce I GOODRICH</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Subj: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re: Franklin P. Goodrich - parents<br>Date: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/2/2002 9:39:14 PM Central Daylight Time<br>From: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hanahou@pacbell.net (GERALDINE HYDE)<br>Reply-to: hanahou@pacbell.net (GERALDINE HYDE)<br>To: &nbsp;CharlieChatfield@aol.com</p>
<p>Dear Cheryl,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been thumbing through L.W. Case's book,THE GOODRICH FAMILY in AMERICA, Chicago: Fergus Publishing Company, 1889. &nbsp;Now, I must caution you about its accuracy; actually, it has many, too many errors, basically because a researcher was hired and Case wasn't much of an editor. &nbsp;Despite the claim that it was placed in his hands "for final revision, rearrangement, and completion, and the work has passed through the press under his supervision", the mistakes are rather obvious. &nbsp;I'll give you a case in point: &nbsp;my gggrandfather, Collins W. Goodrich, married Mary Ann Sackrider in Swanton, VT.on Jan. 26, 1823; she died 10 months and 8 days later. &nbsp;Case credits her with all five children!!! &nbsp;She had no children. &nbsp;Collins married the second time in 1829 to Mary Van Duzee. It was they who were my gggrandparents! &nbsp;Their five children were born in 1831 (Cordelia), 1833 (Abigail, my ggrandmother), 1835 (Minerva), 1836 (Marion) and 1842 (James V.). The Vermont 1830 and 1850 censuses prove<br>this.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your line from your first ancestor William descends through &nbsp;John, Jacob, Elijah, Daniel, Daniel, Calvin Pierce Goodrich, born Oct. 20, 1817, Married Delia (sic) F. Price, Feb. 27, 1842; residence, Guttenburg, Iowa. Their son Frank (sic) was the sixth of the seven children, and his birth is listed as April 13, 1856, and a marriage to Lena V. Merz took place January 4, 1882. &nbsp;Only one child is listed: Andrew C. born Oct. 29, 1886. &nbsp;(Because of the publication date, there is nothing more on Andrew and it's possible<br>there were more children and more marriages for Calvin.) &nbsp;Calvin's mothers name was Laura Pierce; hence, his middle name and, possibly, that of his son's.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to have a copy of the pages from which I got the above information, please send your home address via e-mail, and I'll xerox them for you.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our connection is that your ancestor John Goodrich was an older brother of my ancestor, David Goodrich; therefore, we are cousins, albeit distant ones at that.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, an excellent source for the Goodrich family is Stewart Goodrich. &nbsp;He has done a whale of a job researching the Goodrich family, and I am sure he could help you. &nbsp;His e-mail address is stugood@worldnet.att.net. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been a tremendous help for me, and you'll find he also thinks Case did a lousy job. &nbsp;(The Mormons took Case's "word" for his material and repeated the errors I told you about above re my family. I have found they are neither reliable nor particularly truthful about their records and claims!!!)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope what I have given you will be of help and not a repeat of your own hard labors.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much luck, cuz, and do let me know if you want copies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerry</p>

Seymour. &nbsp;One in 1883 Book 37 page 441 and one in 1883 Book 45 Page 445. &nbsp;The second entry is marked Deceased. &nbsp;The first is marked "Inc." &nbsp;If this is William A.'s wife, it might have something in there about Mary Elizabeth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you checked the cemetery records to see where Enos and Mary are buried? &nbsp;Are they next to each other? &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope some of this helps. &nbsp;I really don't know much about the Spangler's. &nbsp;That was my husband's side of the family and haven't even started on that. &nbsp;Kathy Spangler-Dubuque LOOK-UP</p>
