 Nov 27th 1861<br>
 Dear Father<br>
 I thought I would send you a few lines to inform you where I was and what 
I was about.&nbsp; I am a Soldier in defense of my Country at present at these
Barracks.&nbsp; I enlisted last Sept the 14th.&nbsp; I have been at Camp
McClellan in Davenport until about two weeks since we came down here.&nbsp; 
There is now about 30 thousand of us here in camp, including all there is 
about 6 Regiments from Iowa here.&nbsp; We expect to march from here soon 
for Columbus, Kentucky or some other point we hardly know where.&nbsp; I left
my family in Wilton and I should like it if you could manage to pay them
a visit this winter some time and see how they are getting along.&nbsp; They
would no doubt like to see you but they strictly forbid my writing to you
about them when I left, but I thought best to write for your presents (presence)
might cheer them up.&nbsp; Lib was rather opposed to my coming but I considered
it my duty to come, whether it was or not I am not able to say, time will
determine that.&nbsp; I am Sargent (Sergeant) of Cop. D of the 11th Regt.
Col. A.M. Hair (Hare) of Muscatine, probably you know him, he that was Maj.
Hair (Hare).&nbsp; If you get this letter you must answer it the next mail
if you possibly can.&nbsp; Go down and see how the affairs are getting along
at Wilton, it would give me a great deal of ease for you know nothing how
it worries me a thinking about their welfare and cheer them up for I think
the war will soon close or it will be hard on the south. Secesh (secessionist's)
is on all sides of us here.&nbsp; Gen. Fremont left here yesterday, God forbid
that ever another as good man should leave under such circumstances as he
did, the best commander that ever was west of the Mississippi.&nbsp; Gen.
Halack (Halleck) is now under command.&nbsp; The Iowa 7th is in a bad condition,
nearly all cut to pieces.&nbsp; There is not enough of it left to make a
good company.&nbsp; The 12th is at your place yet I suppose.&nbsp; I left
rather in confusion.&nbsp; There was at that time talk of drafts and I dreaded
that.&nbsp; If you answer this I will write again soon and let you know how
we prosper, but do go down and see how they get along. I am not concerned
but what they will have enough to eat but to cheer them up and see to things.&nbsp;
It is getting late and time to crawl (under) the covers.<br>
 Yours truly<br>
 B Chatfield<br>
 NOTE BY CHERYL:&nbsp; The original letter contained no punctuation.&nbsp; 
I added the puctuation to make it easier to read. <br>
