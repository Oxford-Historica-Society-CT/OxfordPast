Henry , Ia CHATFIELD</b></p>
<blockquote><p>HENRY CHATFIELD (1588-1636): &nbsp;Of South Mundham in the parish of Pagham and of North Mundham, Sussex, England. &nbsp;He was the testator 1636/37, b. in 1588, and was bur. at North Mundham on Feb 1, 1636/37.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, as stated previously under his presumed father, George, positive proof has not been found that he was son of George of Pagham, and his wife Margaret (Mnu). &nbsp;The father left no will and the early registers as well as the manor rolls of Pagham are lost, yet the circumstantial evidence furnished by place, names and elimination seems conclusive, as follows:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1610 Henry Chatfield appears in the subsidy at Pagham, where it<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is known that his presumed father George, presumed uncles Richard and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis, and his presumed great-uncle George resided and possessed landed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property for more than half a century.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry named his eldest dau. Margaret, probably for his mother,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two of his sons George and Francis, the former evidently for his father and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his great-uncle, and the latter for his uncle and his grandfather.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exhaustive search among all Chatfield's of Sussex in the sixteenth <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the first half of the seventeenth century has failed to disclose the names &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George and Francis, except among the descendants of the armigerous landed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branch founded by the Richard Chatfield of Chichester, who d. in 1586.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Henry Chatfield, appears in subsidies at Pagham in 1610 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 1620/21, when he was still a young man, and therefore at his marriage he <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was probably well established by his father, who must have been a man of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property, as George of Pagham certainly was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of this Henry Chatfield indicates that he was a man of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substantial estate; and each of his sons, Francis, Thomas and George, who <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emigrated to New England in 1639, is there styled as "Mr." or "Gentleman".<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as it seems evident from the foregoing reasons that Henry <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chatfield was descended from the Richard of Chichester who d. in 1586, it also <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems, by process of elimination, that he cannot be placed in that branch of the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family except as a son of George of Pagham.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidies show that Henry Chatfield resided at South Mundham in Pagham, but his will indicates that he had lands also in North Mundham. &nbsp;Doubtless most of his children were bapt. at Pagham, the early registers of which are missing; but he also lived at North Mundham, where he was in the land scot in 1633 and where he was buried.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protestation Roll of Feb 1641/42 for the western half of Sussex, containing the names of all males eighteen years of age and upwards in each parish, is preserved in the House of Lords, and has been printed. &nbsp;While the names of the two sons-in-law of Henry appear on the roll, the names of his sons Francis, Thomas and George are not on it. &nbsp;They had gone to New England in 1639.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry md. 1st, abt 1610, Margaret (Mnu), who d. early in 1614, and 2nd, prob. late in 1614, Jane (Wickham) Wickham, widow (perhaps of George Wickham of Hunston), the testatrix of 1638/39, who was bur. at North Mundham on Mar 17, 1638/39. &nbsp;It appears, by her will, that she had at least one son and also two daughters by her first mg.: &nbsp;Elizabeth, wife of Edward Fowle; Martha, wife of William Largish.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land Scot for West Mundham Parish 1633: &nbsp;Henry Chatfeilde, 2 coats - (coat- measure of land). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land Scot for Runcton, East part of Mundham Parish 1633: &nbsp;Mr. Chatfield (Henry?), half a yard land.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Will of Henry Chatfield [the probate act styles him of North Mundham], Jan 28, 1636/7.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be bur. in the churchyard. &nbsp;To the High Church of Chichester, (Sussex, England) 6d. &nbsp;To Habell Ingram my son-in-law 12d. &nbsp;To my son John Chatfield 12d. &nbsp;To my son Edward Fowle 12d. &nbsp;To my son Francis Chatfield 100 pounds, providing that he surrender his estate in those copyhold lands that he is estated in unto his brother Thomas Chatfield, which if he refuse to do, I give him 12d. for his portion. &nbsp;To my son Norriss' children, George, Annis, and Joseph, 15 pounds to be equally divided among them at the age of twenty-one. &nbsp;If my son Francis die before the age of twenty-one years, reversion of his portion to my sons Thomas Chatfield and George Chatfield, equally divided. &nbsp;If my son Thomas die, then my lands shall go to Francis Chatfield, and if Francis die, then to George. &nbsp;To my younger son, George Chatfield 100 pounds at the age of twenty-one, and if he do not live so long, reversion to my sons Francis Chatfield and Thomas Chatfield equally divided. &nbsp;To my wife Jane the use of my lands for life, and my best bed furnished. <br>Executor: Edward Fowle, Overseers: Thomas Peirse and John Smith, to each of whom I give 3s 4d.<br>[Signed] The mark of Henry Chatfield, <br>Witnesses: Thomas Whighd, and John Buckner. <br>Proved Mar 3, 1636/37 by Jane Chatfield;
