Thomas Chatfield , Ia ******</b></p>
<blockquote><p>THOMAS CHATFIELD (1450-0000): &nbsp;He is the first CHATFIELD from whom a continuous descent can be trace. &nbsp;According to the visitations of Sussex, he was of Bedyles in the parish of Ditchling. &nbsp;He was probably living in 1523 when Thomas Chatfield, Jr., presumably his son, appears in a subsidy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife's name has not been learned.<br>"Genealogical Research in England".</p>
<p>The arms of the CHATFIELD FAMILY were granted in 1564. &nbsp;They were recorded in the Heralds College at London, England, and are thus described:</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARMS: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argent, a griffin sable on a chief purple, three escallop shells, argent.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREST: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An heraldic antelope's head erased argent, ducally gorged or.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOTTO: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fidus ad extremum" &nbsp;(Faithful to the end).</p>
<p>The 'griffin' is a fabulous animal used in heraldry, combining the eagle and the lion, and was used by those having both temporal and spiritual authority, as for example, the early church barons.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'escallop shells' indicate the ancestor of the family made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'antelope' is symbolical of unswerving fidelity.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ducally gorged means with a ducal crown around its neck.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In heraldic language 'chief' means the upper part of the shield.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Argent' signifies silver, which is an emblem of purity.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Or' is gold, which indicates sterling worth.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sable' is black, and is indicative of antiquity.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHATFIELD FAMILY is of Sussex origin and doubtless derived its name from Catsfield, a parish in southeastern Sussex, one mile from the famous Battle Abbey, which was built on the spot where King Herold fell in the Battle of Hasting or Senlac. &nbsp;As early as 1300 the family was established in Mid-Sussex, the first of the name there of whom records have been found being William de Cattefeld, who in 1327/38 and 1332/33 was taxed in subsidies in the Twp. of Street, in the very center of the county and about twenty-five miles west of Catsfield.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over three centuries the family continued in Street and the adjoining parishes of Ditchling and Chailey; but after 1332/33 there is a gap of about 120 years, covering four or five generations, concerning which no records have been discovered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THOMAS CHATFIELD (1450-0000): &nbsp;He is the first CHATFIELD from whom a continuous descent can be trace. &nbsp;According to the visitations of Sussex, he was of Bedyles in the parish of Ditchling. &nbsp;He was probably living in 1523 when Thomas Chatfield, Jr., presumably his son, appears in a subsidy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife's name has not been learned.<br>Cheryl (Chatfield) Thompson.</p>
