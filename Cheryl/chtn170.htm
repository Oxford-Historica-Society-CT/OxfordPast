<blockquote><p>LETTER FROM OLIVE ADELIA LAKE BLAKESLEY</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday evening July 13, 1856, Cherry Grove</p>
<p>Dear home and all the folks,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that I would write a few lines to you this evening so you could see we are all well at present and harvesting as hard as we can but not very many hands. &nbsp;It is very warm but not very dry. &nbsp;The wheat is very good where it has not been pastured. &nbsp;Julia gets some lonesome but I guess she will stand it. &nbsp;Henry and Edmund and two other fellows are lying on the grass swapping lies, as fast as they can.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been to beast(?) grove to meeting. &nbsp;It was a universalistic meeting and very glad we was to hear the good word preached by one what could preach. &nbsp;We heard a sermon from Bellr Day from Chicago. &nbsp;Julia was very much pleased with the meeting. &nbsp;Harriet you seem to think that we would get tired reading your letter. &nbsp;I should like to get such a letter every day from home. &nbsp;We have been looking for pa and ma for a long time, but we do not see any thing of them yet, but hope we will before long. &nbsp;We have some little excitement here at present and as this letter will not reach you till the excitement is past I suppose that I may whisper it in your ear. &nbsp;Now, listen, for I am going to speak it. &nbsp;Esther is about to leave this world of woe and go to a world of trouble. &nbsp;I suppose the awful change will be on Thursday the 24 of the present month and then she will be Mrs. Sikes. &nbsp;Can you read that? &nbsp;If you cannot why just come down here and I will tell it to you. &nbsp;I do not know but Henry will grieve himself to death, but I guess he will live through it.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmund say that if you dare to come down here he will beat you scuffling. &nbsp;Charles often wishes for Aunt Harriet to come down here so that he can see her. &nbsp;You would hardly know him or Orvis, they have grown so. &nbsp;It is very dry here. &nbsp;Every thing is dying for the want of rain. &nbsp;We have a few little potatoes once in a while and a cucumber too at a time.. &nbsp;We have too beets and three peas and half a dozen beans to a time, so no more since with the &nbsp;mow to it. &nbsp;Tell Pa that we got too big BB calves as well as him. Our black cow has got a white calf. &nbsp;Ain't that funny &nbsp;The boys have got their wheat cut and just put up all of it except some that they could not bind and that lays just as they cut it and that is all about it until they get it stacked. &nbsp;I am getting almost out of thinking timber I guess. &nbsp;Henry says that he is coming up home when he gets his wheat hauled off and then I am going to send you some of the best books that you every read and you have not read them yet. &nbsp;I guess I will stop for this time for if I do not I will not have anything to write next time. &nbsp;It is Saturday night and I am going over to help Esther cook a little tomorrow. &nbsp;I guess it will be better if it is cooked Sunday. &nbsp;It is getting late and I must stop for this time so good bye till I hear from you again and then you shall hear from me one more. &nbsp;Give &nbsp;my love to Pa and Ma and all the children and hope that poor old Major's tail has got well.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your affectionate sister,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O.A.L.B.</p>
