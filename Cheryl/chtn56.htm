<blockquote><p>HISTORY OF PEORIA and STARK CO.'S IN ILLINOIS<br>ESSEX TOWNSHIP<br>Elected Sylvanus Moore, Greenleaf Smith and Benjamin Smith, trustees. Moses Boardman was elected in 1835. Madison Winn in his paper of 1886, says: “On the fourth day of July, 1834, the people came together for the purpose of building a school house. The site chosen was near the northeast corner of the northeast quarter of Section 15, in Essex Township. The building was planned to be twenty feet square, and all went to work with a will, some cutting, some hauling, some making clapboards, and others building. By noon it was built up waist high; and there coming a shower, we arranged the clapboards over the wall and underneath ate our Fourth of July dinner. The first day the walls were built up to the roof, which was soon covered, and from Leak’s mill slabs were brought for seats. A post was driven into the ground and a slab laid on it for a teacher’s desk, while mother earth was the floor. Adam Perry commenced school about July 15th, with about thirty scholars. (This Perry received $55.50 for teaching the winter school of 1834-5 for three months. Sabrina Chatfield, later Mrs. Hilliard, received $13.00 for a three months’ summer school in 1835, and Mary Lake $6.34 1-4 for six weeks’ teaching during the fall term.) In the fall the house was finished -- a floor put in above and below, three windows sawed out, the east one having a light of glass in it, the other two covered with cloth, cracks plastered up with yellow clay, holes bored in the walls in which pins were inserted and slabs laid on for desks, and a sod chimney built. Sabrina Chatfield, better known as Grandmother Hilliard, of Lafayette, now taught, and was the first female teacher conducting a school in the county. Next were Jesse W. Heath, Mary Lake, Joseph R. Newton, William Samis and -----.</p>
