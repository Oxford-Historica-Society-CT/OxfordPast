                <td valign="top">Oxford September 9th, 1855<br>
       My Dear Children:<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; I now sit down to write an answer to the last received
 bearing   date August 19th which was thankfully received as we feel anxious
 for your   welfare, we are glad to hear you are in comfortable health and
 hope it may   continue.&nbsp; This is the first great blessing we can enjoy.&nbsp;
 You  say Freddy is feeble.&nbsp; I am sorry to hear it.&nbsp; I hope he
will  be  better when cold weather comes, but we must not set our hearts
on anything.&nbsp;    Our children are near and dear to us but we can not
keep them when they  are  called, we must say, "Thy will be done, not mine.
Oh!&nbsp; Heavenly "Father<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The sad news we all hear from Davenport makes our hearts
  ache  that Charley is numbered with the dead and that we can never see
his   face  more.&nbsp; (NOTE FROM CHERYL:&nbsp; This is in reference to
death  of her  son Charles Smith Chatfield).&nbsp; We all mourn his loss,
his young   companions  seem to feel it much. We had the bell toll for his
death and  a funeral sermon  preached, we missed our absent children.&nbsp;
The sermon   was mostly to the  young, the text was,&nbsp; My son give me
thine heart.&nbsp;   He spoke very  feelingly to us all.&nbsp; How suddenly
he was called from   earth and the uncertainty of all things and may we ever
keep it before us,   and strive to be ready to follow him and may we all
be gathered into one  fold under one shepherd.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Sunday today and we have no church and I
improve    a part of the time in conversing with you on paper.&nbsp; I sit
by the north   window in the east room and it is a very pleasant morning.&nbsp;
We have  a great many flowers in bloom in our dooryard and cool shades.&nbsp;
I think   of&nbsp; the many blessings we have and try to forget our sorrows,
truly this is a mixt cup we drink on earth, we rear families and they go
out from us.&nbsp; It causes grief in the parents hearts to hear sad news
from their children, it also rejoices them when when they prosper.&nbsp;
You write you are a doing well now.&nbsp; That you are building a brick house
near home.&nbsp; Have you moved from the farm of your father or how comes
it to be that you are building so near your door?&nbsp; Is the building for
yourself or not?&nbsp; We heard it was from Mr. Dunbar's son.&nbsp; We do
not understand how it is.&nbsp; Do not involve yourself in debt, keep clear
of that as possible for it would cause you trouble.&nbsp; Take care for the
coming winter.&nbsp; Have a good cellar and store it well with things for
your comfort and try to go and see Mary, before winter, and see if she is
like to have things for her comfort.&nbsp; They have been sick so much and
pay high rent.&nbsp; I am afraid how they will get along through the coming
winter. Do not harbor any ill will towards them, be kind and affectionate
towards your brother and sister, and forgive if they have done amiss.<br>
Sunday afternoon, I have been to take a walk in the garden and see our vegetables.&nbsp;
We have a very good one for us, we have sweet corn and beans, a plenty beets,
cucumbers, squashes, seed pumpkins, and potatoes, but the potato not has
commenced rapidly, there has been a great many potatoes planted, but a small
yield, buckwheat looks well, corn likewise, also turnips, the hay crop is
light, oats are good, apples plenty.&nbsp; Your Uncle Chester Chatfield,
is coming up tomorrow to paint our house and fence.&nbsp; Your father and
the boys have done the farming, they have not hired a days work.&nbsp; We
have six cows and six hogs.&nbsp; It is getting quite<br>
dry for the want of rain. We have had a great deal of rain   through the
month of July and the green is much injured.&nbsp; It has been   quite sickly
at Seymour this summer and a number of deaths.&nbsp; Doctor  Stoddard's wife
is dead, Mr Mosier likewise, the others are strangers.&nbsp;   There was
nine deaths in one week, but it has been very healthy in our town   as yet.&nbsp;
I saw Mrs Dunham last week, she was in good health with the   rest of the
family.&nbsp; Pretsey Leeks health is improving, she was walking   down here
today.&nbsp; Amanda is home, she is not able to do much, she is   going to
return this week.&nbsp; Frank is not much better, he has just returned  
from a visit to his grandmother Cables.&nbsp; Horace C&nbsp; is quite on
 the decline.&nbsp; Hannah (Cable) Writer, has a throat complaint and is
quite   feeble.&nbsp; Julia&nbsp; (Cable) Clark likewise.&nbsp; Frederick
(Cable)   and wife (Sarah (Davis) Cable) I understand are thinking of moving
to ___?___    in October.&nbsp; Horace is at ___?___ ?Hugars? and some think
he will never  return.&nbsp; We think he has but a short time stay on earth.&nbsp;
I do not think of much news interesting, but if you was here you would think
of many questions to ask about.&nbsp; I/we would sit down and chat together
a little while instead of writing.&nbsp; I should be glad, but it is not
so and we must be content to converse on paper, which is a great privilege.&nbsp;
 Write often for we are anxious to hear from you. <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This from your mother<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R. Chatfield<br>
       <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elizabeth be very careful about sitting Fredy on
 a  chamber  if he has that weakness about him, it will make the "piliss"
worse.&nbsp;   Harriet was troubled in that way, we had Doctor Stone, he
told us to get  iron filens and put lemon and a loaf sugar to them and put
them into sperrits  and give it to her and it seemed to help her.&nbsp; He
said we must not set  her on a chamber.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can ask a doctor about it if you please.&nbsp;
   I have forgotten the rule for mixing how much of each sort.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
