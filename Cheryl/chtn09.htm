John , II M.D. DURAND</b></p>
<blockquote><p>JOHN DURAND, II M.D. (1700-1773): &nbsp;John lived in Oxford, New Haven, CT, which was formerly a parish in Derby, New Haven, CT. &nbsp;In 1727 he was on the list of proprietors who purchased Quaker Farms which later became part of Oxford, New Haven, CT .<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was a self-educated man and made good progress in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, without an instructor. &nbsp;He was so well-informed in business topics that he was often called upon to settle matters that threatened lawsuits. &nbsp;Most of the wills that were offered for probate in the section of town in which he lived were written by him. &nbsp;As a physician, he did not meet with the success that was his father's. &nbsp;His manners were somewhat abrupt, and yet he was a practical, sound, common-sense man who made the most of the meager opportunities he had for education in early life. &nbsp;He succeeded well in business."<br>By: &nbsp;S. R. Durand;<br>Genealogy.com (LLC), Broderbund (FTJ), Vol. 55, Tree 2454.</p>
