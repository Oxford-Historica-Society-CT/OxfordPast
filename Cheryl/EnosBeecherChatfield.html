      <div align="center">THE LIFE OF ENOS BEECHER CHATFIELD<br>
      </div>
      <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Enos Beecher Chatfield was born in Oxford, New Haven Co.,
CT on Mar 5, 1828. His father was Enos Chatfield and his mother was
Roxy (Sperry) Chatfield. In all of the references to him in his adult
life, and in his signatures, the Enos was dropped and he was referred
to as Beecher Chatfield. In a letter to his father-in-law, he signed it
B. Chatfield. Beecher, like his father, was a bricklayer and stone
mason.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He met Mary Elizabeth Seymour, and married her in Oxford,
CT, on Sep 14, 1852. Beecher called her Lib. Mary Elizabeth was born in
Massachusetts on Nov 14, 1833, but lived in Dubuque, Iowa at the time
they married. Her father was William A. Seymour and her mother was
Sarah Dunham. Her maternal grandmother was Lucy (Ariail) (Dunham)
(Hart) Stearns (1781-1867), who lived in Oxford, New Haven Co., CT, and
it is believed she was either living with Grandmother Lucy, or visiting
her, when she met and married Beecher in Oxford, New Haven Co., CT <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Beecher and Lib were living in Seymour, CT, where their
first child Frederick Seymour Chatfield was born on Dec 24, 1853. A
second child, William Howard Chatfield was born on Oct 11, 1854, but he
died on Jul 10, 1855. William Howard is buried in Wilton, IA. It is for
certain that sometime between Dec 1853 and July 1855 Beecher and Lib
removed from Connecticut to Iowa.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;On Jun 11, 1856, Beecher bought a piece of property from
W. R. Newton in Wilton Junction, IA, now known as Wilton, IA. He paid
$1 for Lot 2 of Block 7 of Peter Marolf's Addition to Wilton, IA.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A daughter, Lucy Ariel Chatfield was born on Jul 27, 1856,
in Wilton Junction, IA. Lucy was the first child born in Wilton
Junction. <br>
      <br>
A HISTORY OF WILTON JUNCTION, IOWA<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The area that became Wilton, IA (called Wilton Junction
until 1970) was a prairie of about 8 square miles. There were no trees,
except along the creek banks, because the roots could not penetrate the
sod.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The first settler was Christian Marolf from Switzerland,
who settled on 80 acres he bought from the government in 1849. In 1851,
a second settler arrived.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1854, the town was laid out and in 1855 the railroad
was brought through the town. There was a building boom after the
railroad was finished. The railroad only went as far west as Iowa City,
and south to Washington.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the summer of 1856 there was planned a grand 4th of
July celebration. It was a full blown celebration, people from miles
around came. Music was supplied by the best band in the county, in fact
every musician in the county, a fiddler and a tenor drum. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a great privilege to be identified with a new town
or country. One thing about a new town is, old and young people have to
work, and through work, character is developed that is worthwhile.
Although the young people had left the advantages of culture the East
provided, they endeavored to help each other by organizing a Good
Templer's Lodge, which had a large membership, and old fashioned
singing groups, with a party thrown in now and then. Houses were
scarce, but many had happy homes in two rooms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Frost came early in 1856, so turnips were frozen in the
field, and the following winter was bitterly cold. A number of people
were afflicted with fever and ague. Beecher continued his trade as
stone mason and bricklayer in Wilton Junction.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;On Mar 18, 1858, Beecher and Lib had another child, Anna
Augusta Chatfield. On Feb 28, 1860, they had a fifth child, Clara
Virginia Chatfield, but sadly the baby died in April of the same year.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The breaking out of hostilities at the beginning of the
Civil War in the spring of 1861, caused great excitement to Wilton
Junction as it did
elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <blockquote>BEECHER'S CIVIL WAR EXPERIENCE<br>
            <br>
It will always be remembered, with patriotic pride,<br>
that Wilton responded nobly. Two full companies<br>
were organized in Wilton of nearly two hundred men.<br>
The first was Company D, of the Eleventh Iowa<br>
Volunteer Infantry. The second was Company G,<br>
of the Thirty-Fifth Iowa Volunteer Infantry.<br>
The first Company (D) was organized in September,<br>
1860, and was officered as follows:&nbsp; A.J. Shrope,<br>
Captain; B.F. Jackson, First Lieutenant; Andrew<br>
Walker, Second Lieutenant.<br>
            <br>
They were a fine body of men and received their<br>
baptism of fire at the battles of Pittsburgh Landing<br>
and Shiloh, the killed and wounded being nearly<br>
one-third of the force of the Company. Appended<br>
is a list of those killed, and who died afterward<br>
of wounds received in those battles.<br>
Henry Seibert, Thomas J. Cory, Peter Craven,<br>
Wm. Leverich and Wm. White were killed, and<br>
John A. Hughes, George Miller, Beecher Chatfield<br>
and R. R. McRea were severely wounded at the battle<br>
of Shiloh, April 6th, 1862. Van V. Reeves was<br>
wounded at Lovejoy's Station, Georgia, and<br>
Perry Starrett at Kenasau (Kennesaw) Mountain.<br>
            <br>
The Company "went veteran" at Vicksburg, in<br>
February, 1863, numbering thirty-six, under the<br>
following commissioned officers: Andrew J. Shrope,<br>
Captain, Augustus C. Blizzard, First Lieutenant,<br>
and James M. Kean, Second Lieutenant.<br>
            <br>
In March, 1863 they came home under command of<br>
Lieutenant Kean, on furlough, and were joyfully<br>
received by friends and relatives. Speeches, dinners,<br>
and a good time generally was the order for the ensuing<br>
thirty days, at the end of which time they returned<br>
to the field where they joined Sherman's forces<br>
(then moving on Atlanta) at Ackworth, Georgia, and<br>
were under fire eighty-four days in succession.<br>
They continued with Sherman through Georgia and the<br>
Carolinas, and took part in the grand review at<br>
Washington, at the close of the war.<br>
            <br>
In the year 1862, a draft was talked of, and a<br>
notice was given that every person between the<br>
ages of eighteen and forty-five years must report<br>
to the Medical Board, at Muscatine to be examined<br>
as to their ability to do military duty, and it<br>
was during this examination that the remarkable<br>
discovery was made that all but two, who were<br>
able-bodied men had enlisted.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Beecher enlisted in the 11th IA Infantry on Sep 14, 1861,
and arrived at Camp McClellan, near Davenport, IA for muster on Oct 3,
1861. For readers that are not knowledgeable about the terms used for
the opposing sides in the Civil War, Beecher was a northern soldier in
the Union Army (USA), and would be called a Yankee by a Southerner. A
southerner would be in the Confederate Army (CSA), and would be called
a Rebel (or frequently called a Sesh, short for a succesionist). The
11th IA is a Regiment, it was composed of ten companies with each
company having about 100 men. A Brigade consisted of several Regiments.
A division consists of several Brigades, and several divisions would
make a unit called an Army. The Army of Tennessee was the Union group
that Beecher was in during the Battle of Shiloh, but the North also had
the Army of Ohio, and the Army of the Potomac.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Beecher left at home his 27 year old wife with 7 year old
Freddy, 5 year old Lucy, and 3 year old Anna, and (probably unknown to
him and Lib) an unborn child, Sarah Henrietta Chatfield who would be
born on June 18, 1862.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The 11th IA Regiment consisted of ten companies, and at
the time of muster (organization) it consisted of 922 men. Beecher was
made Third Sergeant of Company D. The 11th IA Infantry was the first
regiment armed and equipped before leaving Iowa. Honoring the funeral
of Lt. Colonel Wentz of the Seventh Iowa (killed in battle at Belmont,
Missouri), it presented IA citizens their first view of a marching
regiment in army blues.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Abraham M. Hare, who had been a major of militia in Ohio,
was the regiment's first colonel. Wounded at Shiloh, he resigned, and
the regiment's history was largely made under Col. William Hall. Col.
Hall was educated at Oberlin College and the Western Military Institute
of Kentucky. He studied law at Harvard. In 1864, when Colonel Belknap
was promoted ahead of him to General, he resigned in a huff.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;When during its days at the Davenport, IA camp, the
regiment complained of having "nothing to eat" except baker's bread,
fresh beef, vegetables, apples and cucumber pickles, the Muscatine
women produced cake, fruit, roast turkey, chicken salad, boiled ham,
tongue, and mince pie in such lavish amounts, the regiment's command
almost passed to the medical officers. In the lean years ahead when the
men were living off a country already stripped to the bone, they looked
back with longing on the days of their "Iowa famine". The Muscatine
newspaper editorialized about the barracks' leaky roofs and the lack of
sanitation at the camp.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;While at Camp McClellan, Davenport, IA the regiment made
some progress in drill (marching and handling of their rifles) and in
learning the duties of the soldier. On Nov 16, 1861 the troops boarded
the riverboat Jennie Whipple for St. Louis. Now their complaint was
exposure to the cold and snow. On Nov 19, 1861 the regiment arrived at
Camp Benton in St. Louis, Missouri.<br>
I &nbsp; n St. Louis, smallpox, measles, mumps and acute homesickness
developed, the last more devastating than the others. On Nov 27th,
1861, while at Camp Benton, Beecher wrote the following letter to his
father-in-law.

Dear Father<br>
I thought I would send you a few lines to inform you where I was and <br>
what I was about. I am a Soldier in defense of my Country at present at
          <br>
these Barracks. I enlisted last Sept the 14th. I have been at Camp <br>
McClellan in Davenport until about two weeks since we came down here. <br>
There is now about 30 thousand of us here in camp, including all <br>
there is about 6 Regiments from Iowa here. We expect to march from here
          <br>
soon for Columbus Kentucky or some other point we hardly know where. I <br>
left my family in Wilton and I should like it if you could manage to
pay them <br>
a visit this winter some time and see how they are getting along. They
would <br>
no doubt like to see you but they strictly forbid my writing to you
about <br>
them when I left, but I thought best to write for your presents
(presence) <br>
might cheer them up. Lib was rather opposed to my coming but I
considered <br>
it my duty to come, whether it was or not I am not able to say, time
will <br>
determine that. I am Sargent (Sergeant) of Cop. D of the 11th Regt.
Col. <br>
A.M. Hair (Hare) of Muscatine, probably you know him, he that was Maj.
Hair <br>
(Hare). If you get this letter you must answer it the next mail if you
possibly <br>
can. Go down and see how the affairs are getting along at Wilton, it
would give me a <br>
great deal of ease for you know nothing how it worries me a thinking
about <br>
their welfare and cheer them up for I think the war will soon close or
it will be <br>
hard on the south. Secesh (secessionists) is on all sides of us here.
Gen. Fremont <br>
left here yesterday, God forbid that ever another as good man should
leave under <br>
such circumstances as he did, the best commander that ever was west of
the <br>
Mississippi. Gen. Halack (Halleck) is now under command. The IA 7th is
in a bad <br>
condition, nearly all cut to pieces. There is not enough of it left to
make a good <br>
company. The 12th is at your place yet I suppose. I left rather in
confusion. <br>
There was at that time talk of drafts and I dreaded that. If you answer
this I <br>
will write again soon and let you know how we prosper, but do go down
and see <br>
how they get along. I am not concerned but what they will have enough
to eat <br>
but to cheer them up and see to things. It is getting late and time to
crawl <br>
(under) the covers.<br>
Yours truly<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;While at Camp Benton, the regiment received instruction in
drill and camp duties, in which it became fairly proficient before
taking the field for active service against the enemy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The regiment left St. Louis on Dec 9, 1861 and from that
date was engaged in a winter campaign, and suffered much from hardship
and exposure. It went first to Jefferson City, MO, and then went up the
Missouri River to Boonville, from which point it sent out scouting
parties, but only found small groups of the enemy. The enemy having
horses and familiar with the country, scattered upon the approach of
the Union infantry troops. The regiment soon returned to Jefferson
City. On Dec 23rd, 1861, a detachment of five companies was sent by
rail to California, MO, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Hall. The
other five companies, under command of Colonel Hare, went to Fulton,
Missouri. While the records do not show any official report of the
operations of these two detachments during the remainder of the winter,
and while no event of special importance seems to have transpired, the
service performed was important, because of the fact that the presence
of these Union troops insured protection to the lives and property of
Union citizens. A large number of rebel soldiers had been raised in
that state, and had joined the rebel army then in camp on its
southwestern border, while small bands infested almost every county,
and many depredations were committed notwithstanding the presence of
Union troops. The Muscatine Journal said the greatest danger of the
winter campaign occurred when five hundred green soldiers and a
reckless crew rode a train loaded with 173 kegs of gunpowder which the
cavalry captured at Boonville.<br>
      <br>
SHILOH BEGINS TO UNFOLD<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;One night in January, 1862, General Halleck chatted
informally at his St. Louis headquarters with Brigadier Generals
Cullum, his chief of staff, and William T. Sherman. The conversation
turned to a discussion of where the Union army should attack the
Confederate army. Halleck placed a large map in the table, took a
pencil, and asked Cullum to draw a line across the map where the
Confederate line lay. Cullum ran a pencil mark through Bowling Green,
Forts Donelson and Henry, and on to Columbus, KY.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"Now," Halleck asked, "where is the proper place to break
it?" Both Sherman and Cullum were aware that others were urging a major
campaign down the Mississippi River, yet they were equally aware of the
Confederate strength at Columbus, Kentucky, where General Leonidas Polk
(CSA) had fortified the river bluffs with tiers of heavy guns. After a
moment's hesitation either Sherman or Cullum spoke up and said,
"Naturally, the center."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Halleck then drew a line perpendicular to the other,
through the middle of Cullum's line. It ran almost parallel with the
course of the Tennessee River. "That," he announced, "is the true line
of operations."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Early in March the two detachments of the Eleventh IA were
ordered to St. Louis and, on March 10, 1862, the regiment was again
united, and two days later was being transported by steamboat down the
Mississippi to Cairo, and then up the Ohio and Tennessee rivers to
Savannah, Tennessee, where it remained until Mar 23rd. On Mar 23rd, the
11th IA moved to Pittsburgh Landing, and became a part of the large
army then being concentrated at that point and destined to soon be
engaged in one of the greatest battles of the war. The 11th Iowa was
assigned to the First Brigade of the First Division of the Army of the
Tennessee. Maj. General Ulysses S. Grant was the commander of the Army.
Maj. General John A. McClernand commanded the division, and Colonel A.
M. Hare of the 11th IA was in command of the First Brigade. Colonel
Hall took command of the 11th IA, since Colonel Hare was placed in
command of the Brigade.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;For this battle, the Army of Tennessee consisted of six
Divisions, and totaled 39,830 men. Near Pittsburgh Landing the land was
spectacular. Deep ravines, often with small creeks rushing toward the
Tennessee, cut through the rolling hillsides. Two large and swollen
creeks, (Owl and Lick), dominate the region, creating in effect a rough
triangle of campground that extended for three miles before being
interrupted by a range of two-hundred-foot-high hills south of the
landing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lick Creek runs along the northern edge of these hills
joining the Tennessee about two miles south of the landing. Since the
Tennessee River at this point runs almost due north, it nearly
parallels the high ground along the landing and forms the eastern side
of the triangle. The area is often marshy in the spring.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;About a half-mile north of Pittsburgh Landing the second
large creek, Snake Creek empties in to the Tennessee River. Although
Snake Creek continued to the west, its course was directed away from
the landing. A large Snake Creek tributary, Owl Creek, cuts across the
rolling tableland from the southwest, however, forming the western
boundary of Sherman's Pittsburgh Landing campground. Both Lick and
Snake creeks were treacherously deep in the spring, under flood
conditions Owl Creek might reach a depth of thirty feet, but four feet
was more normal.<br>
Sherman saw this triangle of land as a strategic position and "an
admirable camping ground."&nbsp; The terrain, although noted by Sherman
to be of "easy defense by a small command," was not chosen for its
defensive value. Foremost in Sherman's mind was the establishment of an
offensive base of &nbsp;operations. "I ... acted on the supposition
that we were an invading army," he wrote. "The position was naturally
strong ... we could have rendered this position impregnable in one
night, but ... we did not do it. ... To have erected fortification
would have been evidence of weakness and would have invited an attack."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Since Sherman's recommendation had led to the
concentration at Pittsburgh Landing, he, more than any other officer,
was responsible for the army's presence there. More importantly, as the
unofficial camp commander he was in charge of the organization and
defense of the camp.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;As the various divisions and regiments arrived, they were
assigned sites throughout the triangle, most of the new units camping
near the landing. The 11th Iowa's campsite was on Jones Field, near the
west side of the Union camp.<br>
No fortifications were ordered built. Across the 3 1/2 mile southern
base of the triangle, from Lick Creek to Owl Creek, only Sherman's
division guarded the outer perimeter. Between Stuart's brigade and
Sherman's main encampment at Shiloh Church a gap of more than a mile
existed, to be filled by a yet unorganized division. On each side two
swollen creeks barred passage. In the army's rear the broad Tennessee
swirled wildly by, and rapid evacuation or reinforcement was hindered
by the limited landing space below the buffs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;At Corinth, MS, Twenty-two miles away, a large Confederate
Army was quickly forming. Sherman, despite his calculating plans, had
unknowingly placed the Federal army in a natural trap.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;To the men going ashore from the cramped confines of an
Army transport the camp at Pittsburgh Landing was a welcome sight. The
weather, which had been cold and rainy, briefly turned very warm toward
the end of March.<br>
Most of the Federal soldiers found their regimental camps to be quite
comfortable and well equipped. Each company was provided with five
large Sibley tents, pitched close together in a row. For the officers a
smaller square tent was erected at the head of each row. Ovens made of
dried clay were set up to bake fresh bread. Hospital tents were
erected, as was a quarter-master's tent for the storage of regimental
supplies. Some regiments even had potbellied stoves made of sheet metal
to heat their tents.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout the first week in camp most of the time was
consumed in clearing campsites, bringing up supplies from the Landing,
and improving the camps with such refinements as elevated bunks made
from tree poles, so the men might sleep off of the ground.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The job of unloading troops and their equipment and
supplies at Pittsburgh Landing was more difficult than first planned.
High water restricted the landing area so much that Sherman had to back
his boats away in order to allow Hurlbut's troops to land on March 18,
1862. When other Federal troops arrived, they found the landing area
hopelessly jammed. One commander observed that Pittsburgh Landing was
"occupied with boats for its entire length, five deep."&nbsp; By the
time C. F. Smith's division arrived the landing area was so congested
that one of his brigade commanders, Brigadier General John McArthur,
carved out a separate landing area and road in order to speed the
unloading process. So many thousands of troops were found crowding
about the landing that it was necessary for Sherman to move Buckland's
and Hildebrand's brigades out to the Purdy road camps on Thursday, Mar
20.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;By the end of the week the tents of Sherman's division
stretched for nearly a mile through the lightly timbered woods along
the Purdy road. On their far right ran Owl Creek, rain-swollen and out
of its banks, choking the adjacent ravines with backwater and
ankle-deep mud. A long, dry ridge ran along the Purdy road before
falling away into a lowland marsh near the Owl Creek bridge. A little
more than a mile east of this bridge, in the midst of Sherman's camps,
the main Pittsburgh-Corinth road intersected with the Purdy road.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Nearby, on the main Corinth road, a small group of
Southern Methodists had erected a one-room cabin of sturdy logs,
"chinked and daubed." It was named Shiloh Meeting House, after Shiloh,
"A Place of Peace," from the Bible, First Book of Samuel.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;For nearly ten years the local residents had gathered
there to observe the Sabbath. Their little log chapel was built of oak
with hewn walls and a clapboard roof, both of which had long since
weathered and cracked.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Several hundred yards behind the Meeting House, south of
the crossroads, Sherman established his headquarters tent. Sherman
called his camp "Camp Shiloh" and soon started a daily routine of
drill, inspection, and reviews.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Grant so far had relied on the judgment of Generals Smith
and Sherman in organizing the camp at Pittsburgh Landing. On March 19,
1862, however, he steamed upriver to inspect the camps at Crump's and
Pittsburgh Landings. Crump's Landing was a small camp that was
organized shortly before Pittsburgh Landing, and was four miles north
of the Pittsburgh Landing. Lew Wallace's units were at this camp.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Returning that night to Savannah, Grant was satisfied and
reported to his superior Gen. Halleck in St. Louis that the two sites
were "the only ones where a landing can be well effected on the west
bank ..." so far as was known. He was careful to add, however, that
this only applied "to the present stage of water."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of greater importance to Grant was the dispatch from
Halleck that was waiting for him upon his return. Halleck had received
a telegram on the Mar 17 from General Buell (Commander of the Union's
Army of Ohio) in Nashville in which Buell claimed to have "reliable"
information that the Confederates, twenty-six thousand strong, were
marching "to strike the river below Savannah, to cut off
transportation."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Halleck's deceptively ambiguous note to Grant said that if
this was true, "General Smith should immediately destroy (the) railroad
connection at Corinth."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Grant realized that the flooded rivers prevented extensive
enemy operations and dismissed the possibility of Confederate artillery
getting close enough to annoy the river transports. He telegraphed
Halleck, however, that "immediate preparations" would be made to
advance on Corinth according to his instructions. Grant added that he
would go in person, leaving McClernand in command at Savannah.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;When told the next morning that it would take another four
or five days to land all of the troops at Pittsburgh Landing because of
the restricted landing space, Grant estimated that he would be able to
begin his advance by Mar 23 or Mar 24. In anticipation McClernand was
ordered to send two of his brigades on to Pittsburgh Landing and to
have the third follow as soon as a garrison could be organized at
Savannah from the new arrivals.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Several Confederate deserters had just been brought in,
and from them Grant learned "that thirteen cars (had) arrived at
Corinth on the nineteenth" (March 19) with enemy reinforcements. Noting
as well that the roads were almost impassable for artillery and baggage
wagons, Grant delayed his plans to advance. Yet the Confederate
deserters convinced him that Rebel morale was poor and that when
attacked, "Corinth will fall much more easily than Donelson did ...." <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Early on the morning of April 6, 1862, the camps of
General John A. McClernand had bustled with the usual routine of Army
life. Following breakfast, the men began preparing for inspection,
tidying their tents and polishing their brass-adorned equipment with
fine ashes. There was the prospect of a clear, balmy day, and many of
the men were in a good mood.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"It is good to be here," wrote an Iowa soldier, who
considered "what money many would gladly spend to be able to witness
the magnificent view our encampment present(s)."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The surroundings seemed a little more pleasant on this
morning. A number of visitors were in camp, including the wife of
Colonel William Hall of the 11th Iowa. In an Illinois regiment the
young son of a captain had just arrived for a visit. It seemed that the
camp would spend a pleasant Sunday preparing for a future battle at
Corinth.<br>
The calm was first broken by the sound of gunshots far in the distance.
Soon began the "blood curdling sounds", so one soldier thought, of the
"long roll."&nbsp; In a little while several cannon shots passed over
the camps, followed by others that plowed up the ground and tore
through the tents. Trees were splintered nearby, and a shell struck a
horse in the hind leg, mangling it's hoof.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Men scattered in all directions. Wagons and teams were
seen hurrying to the rear. When a projectile from a rifled cannon
whistled close above an Iowa volunteer, it seemed to warn of an
impending disaster.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;McClernand's first reaction had been to send a courier to
Sherman asking what all the firing was about. Then, as most of his
division listened with growing concern to the roar of the guns,
McClernand went to see for himself.<br>
Hare's brigades, which included Beecher's regiment, being camped
farther to the rear, were at the time still formed on their parade
grounds awaiting orders.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Soon thereafter McClernand hurriedly sent orders for
Hare's and Marsh's brigades to advance to the front. Marsh's brigade,
being camped nearest to the front, was the first to advance, marching
in direct support of Sherman. After approaching the right rear of
Sherman's camps, they were halted, and orders soon came to
countermarch. The men later learned that McClernand had belatedly
decided to put his two brigades into line farther to the east, along
the ridge that ran in front of his headquarters.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Here the main Corinth road paralleled the ridge after
making a sharp turn to the northeast about a quarter-mile north of
Shiloh Church. A short distance south of the Corinth road lay an open
field, used for reviews, spanning about twenty acres. Marsh's brigade
had already taken its designated position along the road when Hare's
men came up. Since McClernand wanted Hare formed on his left, his men
had to pass behind the already deployed line to reach their destination.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;While the rest of Hare's Brigade was positioned to the
east of Marsh's Brigade, the 11th Iowa was detached from the brigade at
the very beginning of the battle and during both days received it's
orders direct from Generals Sherman, McClernand, and Grant, and at no
time was the regiment directly connected with any other unit during the
battle, except Dresser's Artillery Battery.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In front of McClernand's troops, including Hare's and
Marsh's Brigades, Sherman and Prentiss's divisions met the charging
enemy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;McClernand, about a quarter-mile on the rear, was warned
of the enemy's approach by Captain Warren Stewart of his staff, who had
made a hasty reconnaissance and escaped under a heavy fire to deliver
his report. Hare's brigade (without the 11th Iowa) was just then moving
along the edge of the review field south of the Corinth road, coming up
to take position on McClernand's left. As they filed along the skirt of
woods, the Confederates, advancing along the opposite side of the
field, opened fire. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The range was considerable, about two hundred yards, but a
few Federals were hit, including the two senior captains commanding the
18th Illinois. Quickly Hare's line was formed, the men standing in
tense anticipation of an attack.<br>
Down the line to the right cannons were roaring, enveloping
McClernand's battle line in smoke. Marsh's brigade was defending this
sector, a 300 yard front bordering on the main Corinth Road. Here four
regiments totaling 1,514 officers and men had deployed along a ridge,
supported by three full batteries of field guns, the artillery forming
the backbone of Marsh's line.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Plugging the gap between Hare and Marsh stood McAllister's
battery of four 24-pounder howitzers. Burrows's 14th Ohio Battery was
ready near the center of Marsh's position, while Dresser's six-gun
battery (and the 11th Iowa) protected Marsh's right. Another Illinois
battery, Schwartz's, was firing from near the crossroads in support of
Sherman's line. In appearance McClernand's line was formidable, but the
men were nervous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The attack began at the strong point, on Marsh's front.
"The enemy were seen approaching in large force and fine style, column
after column moving on us with a steadiness and precision which I had
hardly anticipated," wrote the breathless Marsh. The Confederate
brigade of S.A.M. Wood (CSA), continuing its turning movement after the
retreat of Prentiss, was first to appear despite the severe punishment
it had taken in the advance toward this new Federal front. Although
Raith's (USA) brigade had broken up at the approach of these heavy
Confederate columns, including Weed's, A.P. Stewart's, and Shaver's
troops, numerous tactical mishaps had already fragmentized the
Confederate battle line.<br>
Following the accidental wounding of Wood (CSA) by his own men, his
staff officers hastily attempted to re-form the brigade. Much of the
trouble occurred on the brigade's left flank, where the Confederates
were so disorganized that at least one regimental commander had his men
fall down behind cover on the side fronting the enemy to avoid a fire
from "friendly" troops in the rear.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the left remained stalled, the Confederate right
flank now began to press onward. Their attack was supported by several
batteries, including Bankhead's Tennessee (CSA), firing opposite
Burrow's position (USA). Not far from these cannons lay the 4th
Tennessee of A.P. Stewart's (CSA) brigade, hugging the ground for
protection. &nbsp; &nbsp;When their general came up, he was inspired.
Stewart said he had just talked with one of Bragg's (CSA) staff
officers, who pleaded that the battery in front must be taken. "I
turned to the 4th (Tennessee); told them what was wanted; (and) asked
if they would take the battery..." Stewart recalled with pride. Back
came the reply, "Show us where it is; we will try."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Going forward under the eye of Stewart (CSA), the 4th
Tennessee (CSA) sprinted unsupported into the blasts of canister. Men
fell right and left. According to their commander 31 men were killed
and 160 wounded during this fateful charge.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"If you ever heard the little yellow dogs (brass field
guns) bark," said an excited Federal participant, "... (I) guess they
did some of it there. The fire flew out of their mouths in clouds."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Crossing from the open field into a growth of light timber
to avoid this deadly fire, the 4th Tennessee approached the Federal
line at the double-quick. "We were within 30 paces of the enemy's guns
when we&nbsp; halted, fired one round, (and) rushed forward with a
yell..." wrote an officer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ahead, the 45th and 48th Illinois (USA) were inside the
edge of the woods on Marsh's (USA) extreme left, supporting
McAllister's (USA) battery. The men were standing in line, apparently
unable to see very well through the billowing battle smoke, when the
4th Tennessee suddenly loomed in front. The enemy came nearer, but no
one gave the order to shoot. "What does it mean?&nbsp; Why don't our
officers give the command to fire?" stammered a private.<br>
With the two lines only pistol range part, the strain became
unbearable. Several infantrymen raised their muskets and fired into the
oncoming ranks. "Cease firing!" shouted an officer as he rushed along
the line. "Those are our troops."<br>
Realizing that the flag of the Tennessee regiment had been mistaken for
a Federal flag, some of the men pleaded with their officers that it was
a mistake. The officers still insisted they were Federal troops. "The
hell they are!" roared an excited private. "You will find out pretty
damned soon...."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;By now it was too late. The Confederates were within a
stone's throw, and they threw up their muskets and fired a point-blank
volley.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our men fell like autumn leaves," wrote an embittered
Union private. Another eyewitness, a Federal colonel, later said this
fire was so devastating he thought it unequaled during the entire
battle for destructiveness. "During the first five minutes I lost more
in killed and wounded than in all the other actions," commented a
saddened Marsh (USA) in his official report.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The 48th Illinois (USA) was the first to break. Both the
colonel and lieutenant colonel were hit, and the entire regiment went
to the rear in confusion. "In spite of my efforts to compel them to
stand they fell back..." said Marsh, who became further alarmed when he
saw that the panic was spreading to his remaining regiments.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Other Confederate battle lines were now seen approaching
in successive waves. Some of Wood's (CSA) troops, including the 16th
Alabama and 27th Tennessee, began to head for Burrow's (USA) guns.<br>
&nbsp; The break up of the Federal line was spontaneous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;McAllister's (USA) guns were exposed by the retreat of
their supports, allowing the 4th Tennessee (CSA) to approach on their
right flank. The Rebels were about to surround his battery when
McAllister (USA) gave the order to prepare to retreat. Yet so many
horses had already been killed that one gun had to be abandoned.
McAllister (USA) took four slight wounds, but he got his three
remaining howitzers rolling, just before the 4th Tennessee (CSA) swept
through his battery. One 24-pounder howitzer and two soldiers, "who did
not have time to escape nor courage to fight," said a Confederate
officer, fell into the enemy's hands.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Burrows's (USA) battery of 6 and 12 pounder Wiard rifles
was next to take a pummeling. Their infantry supports also had become
panic-stricken by the growing chaos and already had gone to the rear. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Burrows's (USA) cannoneers were confronted by Wood's (CSA)
troops, among them the 16th Alabama and 27th Tennessee, who raised a
yell and charged for the guns. Seventy horses went down amid the
battery. The underbrush and trees were chopped to pieces in front.
McClernand (USA), who watched nearby, saw his orderly shot down. When
Burrows (USA) and several of his officers fell, the battery became
helpless and was captured in entirety.<br>
The last of Marsh's (USA) regiments, the 11th Illinois, had been
fighting only ten minutes when they saw the sudden retreat taking place
on their left. Immediately the 11th Illinois's line also disintegrated.
"(They) fell back, I regret to add, without my order," wrote Colonel
Thomas Ransom of the 11th Illinois.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Nearby stood McClernand's (USA) third battery, Dresser's
Battery D, 2d Illinois Light Artillery, commanded by Captain James P.
Timony (USA). Their guns had been positioned by Major Taylor (USA) of
Sherman's staff just to the east of a small pool known as Water Oaks
Pond, with the 11th Iowa in close support. Their opponents proved to be
several of Bushrod Johnson's (CSA) detached regiments, the 154th
Tennessee and Blythe's Mississippi Regiment, coming up from the
vicinity of Waterhouse's captured battery. The Tennessee regiment was
directly in the 11th Iowa's front, moving at a measured pace. Here an
Iowa sergeant watched wide-eyed as they approached. "The regiment that
was advancing against us was evidently an A No. 1. One look at them was
enough to convince a man that courage <br>
and discipline are virtues peculiar to neither North or South," said
the sergeant. "Without a waver the long line of glittering steel moved
steadily forward, while, over all, the silken folds of the Confederate
flag floated gracefully on the morning air."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The fighting opened with a roar from the artillery.
Timony's (USA) guns were served so well that they later earned the
praise of Sherman's chief of artillery. "(The fire here was) the most
terrific... that occurred at any time during the fight," said Major
Ezra Taylor (USA). Indeed, so many horses were shot in their harnesses
that all the guns could not be moved in the emergency that followed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;With a determined effort the Confederates forced their way
among the battery, enduring terrific losses at every step. Several
intact teams that had just been hitched to the guns now bounded off
without their drivers, the frightened horses dashing through the lines
of infantry and scattering the men. Nearby, the 11th Iowa's major had
been shot in the head, and its commanding officer unhorsed. The
Confederates were threatening to surround the regiment on the right
when the 11th Iowa hastily scattered, three of its companies becoming
separated in the chaos. Four guns of Timony's battery were overrun
where they stood, completing the near destruction of McClernand's
artillery.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Beecher Chatfield received a severe wound to his right leg
on this day, and this point of the battle was the worst that the 11th
Iowa was involved in on April 6. While the 11th Iowa would join other
units in a fierce battle about an hour later, the majority of the
unit's casualties were injured during this exchange of gunfire.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A great disaster now seemed in the offing. Marsh's (USA)
brigade was a shambles. McClernand's (USA) line was pierced in the
center, and his whole line had begun to break up.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;On Hare's (USA) front the Confederates had simultaneously
advanced in a massed attack. The dapper, five-foot-one-inch-tall
Hindman (CSA), inspired by Johnston's (CSA) promise of another star,
had ordered an immediate advance when he came up and found the Federals
posted along the ridge across Review field. Hindman led in person, at
the head of Shaver's (CSA) brigade and one of Russell's (CSA)
regiments, the 12th Tennessee. When some of Shaver's (CSA) men
protested that nearly all of their ammunition had been expended during
their recent fight with Prentiss (USA), Hindman stopped them short.
"You have your bayonets," he said.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The charge carried directly across the open field at
Hare's (USA) troops, and the field was soon strewn with dead and
wounded.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Before Hindman's (CSA) men could close with Hare's (USA)
infantry, this Federal line also began to crumble. "We gave them one
round of musketry and (we) gave way," later wrote a Federal colonel.
One of Hare's regiments fell back without firing a single volley. Even
the 8th Illinois (USA), on Hare's extreme left, was thrown into
disorder, caused by the stampede on their right. The brigade, already
weakened by the detachment of the 11th Iowa, was further fragmentized
during the retreat when the 8th Illinois fell back in a different
direction. The situation by now was desperate, and only circumstance
intervened to save McClernand's division.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Following Sherman's (USA) urgent request for
reinforcements about 7:30 a.m., Hurlbut (USA) had sent Colonel James C.
Veatch (USA) with nearly three thousand infantry to go to Sherman's
support. Veatch's brigade was soon started along the main Corinth road
for the front, the men marching "with unusual briskness," wrote an
officer.<br>
&nbsp; As they approached Review field shortly after 9 a.m., an officer
rode up in great haste and directed them to move behind Marsh's (USA)
brigade, already formed in the woods beyond the Corinth road. Veatch's
(USA) men quickly moved behind the deployed line, supporting Burrows's
(USA) battery from the rear. A few minutes later the enemy attacked,
and Marsh's (USA) troops were routed. Burrows's battery was "belching
like a volcano" noted an officer, who watched spellbound as a tall
sergeant stood alone to double- shot a cannon and fire it into the
faces of the onrushing enemy. Then the battery's loose horses and mules
bolted to the rear, through Veatch's (USA) line, throwing the 14th
Illinois (USA) into disorder.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;An officer of the regiment, Lieutenant Colonel William
Camm (USA), looked up. "I could see the Johnnies (rebels) running from
tree to tree, and popping away at us as they came," said Camm. Volleys
crashed along the regiment's front, but the 14th Illinois's (USA)
colonel thought he saw an approaching line of men dressed in blue
uniforms. Fearing that they were his own men, he gave the order to
cease firing. A moment later the mistake was recognized and the
fighting resumed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"The enemy (was momentarily) checked but was very
stubborn, and we murdered each other...at close range," Camm (USA)
continued. "Our brigade commander, General Veatch, rode down the line
and I asked him to turn us loose with the bayonet. "No, no," he said,
"you would lose every man."&nbsp; My horse was struck behind the saddle
and lunged among the men so that I let him go. Throwing myself in front
of the colors, (I) tried to get the men to charge, but between us was a
struggling mass of wild and &nbsp;wounded battery horses, many of them
harnessed to the dead, and I could not get them started."&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A Confederate private who had participated in the Review
field attack remembered this, his first battle, as a painful
experience. The fighting, he thought, "was an awful thing.... It
terrified my mind to hear the guns..." and he reflected that he had not
words strong enough to describe the conflict. "Oh, God," was his
prayer, "forever keep me out of such another fight."&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The private was not mistaken--the volume of Federal fire
had been tremendous and the carnage dismaying. Wood's (CSA) brigade was
inoperative following the charge. Its commander had been knocked
senseless when dragged by his runaway horse through a captured camp.
His staff attempted to handle the brigade in his absence, but the
regiments were so wasted as to be unmanageable.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 27th Tennessee (CSA), near Wood's (CSA) right, had
suffered as much as any regiment in the brigade. Its colonel had been
shot in the chest and killed, just as some of his men were struck from
behind by a volley fired by other attacking southern regiments. A
captain was put in command, and when the casualties were counted, the
losses amounted to half the regiment. The brigade was so scattered that
when the 16th Alabama (CSA) advanced to the right to attack Veatch
(USA) following the replenishment of their ammunition, they found no
support and had to await the arrival of Shaver's (CSA) brigade.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the Confederate regiments led by Hindman had
already been so bloodied that there was little further incentive to
resume the advance until compelled to do so. About fifty minutes
&nbsp;had been consumed by the&nbsp; attack, and it was now nearly
eleven o'clock.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the Confederate regimental commanders, left to
their own devices, ordered a halt and rested in the captured camps
while "awaiting orders." One of Wood's (CSA) colonels reckoned that his
men had been fighting for five hours, and he ordered them to rest.
Others marched their men to the rear to find ammunition and stayed
there until ordered back to the front.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Shaver (CSA) regarded his men as too exhausted to
continue. His ammunition was running low, and he received permission to
fall back to Raith's (USA) captured camps, to "supply my men with
ammunition, rest my men, and await further orders."&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Worse still, for a while no one seemed to be in command in
this sector. Hardee (CSA) had been there, along with Bragg (CSA), but
just before Hindman was disabled, Hardee had gone to the right,
satisfied that Hindman was "conducting operations...to my
satisfaction."&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Bragg (CSA) also had departed following Hindman's (CSA)
attack on Veatch (USA), considering that the brigade could do no more.
He already had told Polk (CSA) to take charge of "the center" and
assumed Polk would press on, regarding the enemy resistance here "less
strong" than toward the right.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Polk (CSA) was dismayed to find only three brigades in
position to fight following the impromptu transfer of command. Moreover
the troops were so scattered that none of these brigades was intact,
some being reduced to two regiments in line. The Federals had fled in
several directions following the breakup of McClernand's line,
complicating the tactical problem of pursuit. Moreover logistical
problems continued to disrupt serious attempts to mount an attack. Not
only was ammunition in short supply, but regiments such as the 4th
Tennessee found their muskets so fouled by powder residue that they
could not be loaded.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The result was a disjoined, spasmodic effort on the part
of some Confederate units to resume the offensive, while others went to
the rear for a rest. A.P. Stewart (CSA) took two regiments, one of
which belonged to another brigade, and swung to the northeast along the
Corinth Road. Attacking Veatch's (USA) position soon thereafter, this
weakened column was unable to make headway. Russell (CSA), too, found
his troops badly scattered. With only two regiments he went in the
opposite direction against Raith (USA), their path carrying them
northwest toward the "crossroads." Here they joined a portion of
Bushrod Johnson's (CSA) and Anderson's (CSA) brigade in a bloody
struggle for the important intersection of the Hamburg-Purdy and
Corinth roads.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the fighting abated, entire regiments flung
themselves down to rest or went to the rear seeking ammunition. As
other troops began pillaging the nearby Federal camps, the entire
battleground seemed to be in chaos. The surgeon of the 11th Louisiana
(CSA) remembered with anger that "the sight of all these objects
(trophies) lying about in such abundance was too much for our
men."&nbsp; They were soon loaded down with "belts, sashes, swords,
officer's uniforms, Yankee letters, (and) daguerreotypes of Yankee
sweethearts..." while others were drunk on "Cincinnati whiskey" and
"Philadelphia claret."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Crippled by heavy losses and plagued by a breakdown in
command and communications, the Confederate left wing was temporarily
unable to resume the offensive.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;William Tecumseh Sherman (USA) had found little solace in
the chaos existing amid McClernand's (USA) camps as he fell back about
11 a.m..&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Two regiments, the 46th and 49th Illinois (USA), were
observed in front, sniping at the enemy across Woolf field. But their
position hindered the deployment of artillery, and they were soon
ordered back. Once a fire zone had been cleared, Sherman began to pass
among his men, reorganizing a battle line.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Riding through the pall of smoke nearby was "Sam" Grant,
resplendent in his major general's uniform. He soon found Sherman, and
the two generals here met face to face for the first time on any
battlefield. There was a marked contrast in their appearance. Sherman,
his uniform torn and a bloody handkerchief wrapped tightly around his
hand, was gaunt and disheveled. His wound was inflamed from constant
riding, and the pain had begun to numb his fingers.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The thought may have crossed Sherman's mind that Grant
would be angry. He had predicted "no attack" at the very time when
Grant was relying on him for the utmost vigilance. In consequence the
army had been surprised,&nbsp; and presently was in danger of being
destroyed. His own division, moreover, had been routed and his camps
captured.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Sherman, speaking first, mentioned that he had several
horses killed under him, and he displayed his torn uniform rent by
bullets. This attempt to sway Grant's opinion, if such, was
unnecessary. Grant said he thought Sherman was doing well in stubbornly
resisting the Confederate attack. Then, indicating that his presence
was more needed on the Federal left, he departed following a brief
chat. About all Sherman learned from the conversation was that Grant
had ordered up a resupply of ammunition and that Lew Wallace (USA) was
coming from Crump's Landing with his division.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;What Grant and Sherman did not know was, Lew Wallace was
on the wrong road, and would not arrive at the battle until the next
morning. Sherman's troops were slowly pushed back to a small area near
the landing area, as were the units from the eastern portion of the
battle. Destruction was imminent, but two events were to save the
Federal army and prevent Beecher Chatfield from becoming a prisoner.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A small group of Federal soldiers on the eastern part of
the battle, would take cover on a sunken road. The depression of the
road, combined with a rail fence and a long open area in front of them,
allowed these brave soldiers to hold the Confederate troops on that
half of the battlefield. The Confederates would bring together 62
cannons, the largest concentration of cannons ever seen in an American
battle before, and using aerial bursts to kill the Union soldiers
behind their protection, forced the survivors to surrender.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The other event, thought to be the turning point of the
war, was the death of Confederate General Albert S. Johnston. Johnston
sent his personal physician to treat wounded Federal prisoners and
Confederates. Shortly after, he was rallying his men to attack, when he
slowly fell from his horse. His aides began searching him for a wound.
He had several insignificant wounds, but the one they did not find was
a wound to the back of his right knee. It is possible that Johnston did
not even realize that he was wounded there. A modern pathologist
reports that Johnston had probably been bleeding for a half hour before
he fell from his horse, and a tourniquet applied even 15 minutes after
that would have saved his life. Ironically the bullet is believed to
have been fired from one of his own soldiers. His death affected the
battle of Shiloh directly, in that his command was given to General
Beauregard (of Fort Sumter fame), and some of his commanders were
confused as to what they should do next. All of the Federal troops were
pushed back to a crescent shaped defense line near the landing area.
Historians believe that if Beauregard had continued his push, the
outcome probably would have been the capture of <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Grant's entire army. Several things prevented Beauregard
from continuing the assault; his troops were tired and began to drift
back toward the south, and the sun was beginning to sink below the
horizon. Beauregard (CSA), even though he had been warned that Federal
General Buell was approaching Pittsburgh Landing with the Ohio Army,
did not believe the rumors and thought that he could finish the attack
in the morning.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Even at that moment, Buell (USA) was at the Landing and
his 18,000 troops had began to cross the Tennessee River. Lew Wallace's
7,500 troops also arrived during the night. These reinforcements gave
Grant a 54,600 to 34,000 troop advantage for the next day's battle.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;As horrifying as the day's battles were, that night would
in it's way would be worse. The only Federal hospital ship had made
several trips to Savannah with wounded during the day, but that was
only a small dent in the thousands of federal casualties. All of the
transport ships were loaded with wounded soldiers laying side by side,
every tent, wagon, or cover of any kind was filled with Union wounded.
There was a small house near the landing that the surgeons used as a
hospital, during the night the surgeons were busy with their saws and a
ghastly pile of amputated limbs grew outside the house. The dead were
stacked like firewood outside of this house and the other shelters that
the wounded were taken to.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Even General Grant could not find shelter during the
night. Many of the wounded and dying from both sides could not make it
to either army's lines and were left lying in the open.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The cries and moans from the wounded in the Union camp and
those left on the battlefield mixed as one long wailing that was only
partially drowned out by the cold rain that began to fall at around
midnight. Some of the Union officers were issued blankets, but no one
ate that night. There were many cases of the wounded from both sides
crawling into tents together during the night. The men who had been
enemies during the day, would talk through the night as they died. Many
of the survivors would keep promises made during the night, and deliver
letters and messages to the widows of men that had tried to kill them
during the day.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Federal gunboats fired their big cannons every 10 to
15 minutes into the Confederate camps. The effect was mostly
psychological, and the shooting was intended to keep the Confederates
from sleeping. The Federal soldiers who had survived the day, slept on
top of their rifles. Their tents and blankets were still in their
camps, which were occupied by the Rebels. The men were hungry and
exhausted, but there would be no sleep as they lay in the mud and were
soaked by a rain that was almost sleet. On April 7, the Federal troops
forced the Confederates to retreat, and by early afternoon, the battle
was over.<br>
      <br>
THE BATTLE'S AFTERMATH<br>
The battle at Shiloh was the largest battle in American History up to
that time.<br>
The North suffered 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded, and 2,885 missing. <br>
The South had 1,723 killed, 8,012 wounded, and 959 missing. <br>
This total was more death and injury than the three previous American
wars combined. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The American Revolution produced 10,623 American
casualties, the War of 1812 caused 6,765 American casualties, and the
Mexican War inflicted 5,885 American casualties, adding up to 23,273
American casualties for all 3 previous wars. The Battle of Shiloh
produced American casualties of 23,741, which was 24% of the men
involved in the fight. Grant's army would move to Corinth, Mississippi
and capture it after a much smaller battle.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Americans on both sides changed their opinions that this
war would be a short series of small battles. McClellan's war plans of
small&nbsp; chess likemovements and nearly bloodless battles was viewed
as naive, and the Union Government supported Grant's conclusion, that
the war would not be over until the South was literally destroyed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Beecher would be out of the war after Shiloh. Colonel Hare
was also too injured to fight again. The 11th Iowa was placed under the
command of Colonel Crocker, and became part of "Crocker's Brigade", one
of the fiercest fighting units on either side of the war. The 11th Iowa
went on to the Siege of Vicksburg under Grant, and was with Sherman
during his "March to the Sea".<br>
&nbsp;On August 15, 1862, Beecher was discharged from the army at
Keokuk, Iowa.<br>
On October 11, 1864, Beecher and Lib had another daughter, Mary
Elizabeth Chatfield, but she died December 5, 1864.<br>
On January 8, 1866, they had another son, Edward Beecher Chatfield.
Edward was born in Dubuque, Iowa.<br>
On July 18, 1871, they had another son, Charles Stanley Ross Chatfield.
Charles was born in Wilton Junction, Iowa.<br>
On May 20, 1872, they had another daughter, Nellie Maud Chatfield. <br>
On April 19, 1874, they had another daughter, Emma Gertrude Chatfield.<br>
On March 1, 1877, they had a final child, a son they named Townsend.
Townsend died in Wilton Junction, Iowa on April 13, 1878.<br>
On February 7, 1888, Sarah Henrietta Chatfield, died of Tuberculosis.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;On November 12, 1892, Beecher was admitted to the Iowa
Soldier's Home in Marshalltown, Iowa. The admission form indicates that
Beecher had been an Iowa resident for 38 years, had enlisted one time
during the Civil War, that enlistment being in August of 1861 as a
Sargeant in Company D of the 11th Iowa Infantry under Colonel Hare. The
form also indicates that he was discharged in August of <br>
1862 in Keokuk, Iowa and that the cause of his discharge was a gunshot
in his right leg. He gave his age as 63, his place of birth as
Connecticut, his occupation as Brick mason, his marital status as
married, and his residency as Dubuque, Iowa. The examining surgeon
stated that Beecher was disabled because of heart disease, and that he
was able to care for himself, but was unable to do any manual labor.<br>
On January 24th, 1893, Beecher died at the Iowa Soldier's Home. The
cause of death was listed as Bright's Disease. Bright's Disease is a
disease of the kidneys usually associated with faulty Uric Acid
elimination and is associated with high blood pressure.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Obituary
notice- <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Beecher Chatfield, a member of Hyde Clark Post,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G.A.R., of this city, died yesterday at
the Soldier's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home at Marshalltown. He was a member of
Co. D,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11th Iowa, during the war and was in
several battles."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beecher was buried in Asbury
Cemetery, Asbury, Dubuque Co., Iowa.<br>
      <br>
As an afternote:&nbsp; <br>
It has been rumored among the descendants of Enos Beecher Chatfield and
Mary Elizabeth Seymour that Lib never forgave Beecher for enlisting in
the Civil War. Although several children were born after his discharge,
the rumor says that at some point they had divorced. This rumor does
have some basis in fact as the pension papers for Beecher state his
widow as "Olla Chatfield", and an "Olla Chatfield" shows in Dubuque,
Iowa Census records as a widow.<br>
Again, there is basis in fact from the following newspaper article, no
date is given, but it is presumably from the Newspaper in Dubuque, Iowa.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Newspaper Article, no date, no paper name:&nbsp; Probably Telegraph
Herald, Dubuque, Iowa.<br>

AN AGED HERO<br>
MOSES CLEVELAND:&nbsp; A veteran of the War of 1812, who gave 6 sons to
the Union.<br>
Moses Cleveland, an extremely old man who took part as a youth in the
War of 1812, is here on a visit to his daughter, Mrs. B. Chatfield,
wife of the well known stonemason.&nbsp; He is the son of Col. Augustus
Cleveland of the same war, and furnished six sons to the late civil
war.&nbsp; The old gentleman, though lately ill in Milwaukee, appears
to be remarkably strong for his years, and may be seen in West Dubuque,
where it is probable he will remain.&nbsp; The gentleman's visit was
the occasion of a jolly time at Chatfield hall, West Dubuque, last
evening, under the management of Mr. Hubert Guthrie and friends.&nbsp;
Quinn's band enlivened the young and old with songs and music till
daylight appeared.<br>
      <br>
If you can help me identify "Olla Chatfield", I would appreciate your
help.<br>
