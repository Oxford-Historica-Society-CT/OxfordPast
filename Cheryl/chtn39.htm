<blockquote><p>JOHN LYMAN CHATFIELD, COL. (1826-1863): &nbsp;Col. John was among the first to offer his services, when, after the attack on Fort Sumpter, the President issued his call for 75,000 men. &nbsp;He left Waterbury, New Haven, CT on Apr 20, 1861 with his company, previously the Waterbury City Guard, of which he had been captain for some years. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Washington, in Jun 1861, he was promoted to Colonel of the Third Regiment. &nbsp;Three months later he returned, and was appointed Colonel of the Sixth Regiment. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Fort Wagner, on Jul 18, 1863, he led his regiment over the parapets of the enemy, but fell mortally wounded. &nbsp;Beside him fell the color bearer, shot dead, when Col. Chatfield, with one leg shattered below the knee, yet helped to hold up the colors. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later he was borne from the field and brought to his home, but d. Aug 9, 1863. &nbsp;For his funeral business was suspended in the city, and military men and others throughout the state, assembled to honor his memory. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monument in his honor was unveiled at Riverside Cem., Waterbury, New Haven, CT, with impressive ceremonies, on Sep 13, 1887. &nbsp;The statue, which surmounts a granite pedestal seven feet high, is a life-size figure in bronze, representing Col. Chatfield as a soldier on duty. &nbsp;The orator of the day, Gen. S. W. Kellogg, made a touching reference to Chatfield's courage and patriotism in his last battle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As he was carried bleeding from the scene of carnage in the strong arms of one of his men, his thoughts went back to his regiment and its colors, so dear to every true soldier. "Are the colors saved?" he asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When told that all that was left of them had been safely brought off the field, he replied: &nbsp;"Thank God for that; I am glad they are safe; keep them as long as there is a thread left."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four days afterward, with muffled drum and arms reversed, and music floating in sad and mournful strains upon the summer air, we bore him to his last resting place here; and I gave the order for the final volley fired over his grave. &nbsp;It was all we could do for him, who had done so much and had given his life for us -- to lay him away &nbsp;with all the honors of a soldier's burial, . . . Heroic, Patriotic soul!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The autumn leaves may fall around thy grave for ages to come; the moss and rust of years may gather upon thy monument; this quiet and peaceful city of the dead may become more populous than yonder busy city across the river; but thy name and thy virtues shall remain imperishable in the history of this people."<br>"The Chatfield Family", by William C. Sharpe, 1896, Seymour, New Haven, CT. &nbsp;<br>Connecticut Civil War Grave Sites, 6th Connecticut Infantry<br>Chatfield, John L., Colonel DOW (Ft Wagner), Aug 9, 1863, [Rvrside-Wby]</p>
