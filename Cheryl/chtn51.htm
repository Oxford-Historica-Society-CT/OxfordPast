<blockquote><p>When the Top Came Off: A Connecticut Chest Identified</p>
<p>by Nancy Goyne Evans<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question about the originality of the top of a Connecticut shell-carved cherrywood chest of drawers in the collection of the &nbsp;Winterthur Museum led to the discovery of the maker and date of construction. A narrow strip of wood at the back of the top bearing hinge marks on the bottom surface indicated that repairs had been made. Because a full subtop dovetailed to the case sides lies beneath the finished top, which is nailed in place, it was impossible to inspect the bottom surface of the finished top by removing the drawers and examining the case interior. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic two-board construction of the finished top (without the added piece) is correct, and the profile of the edge compares with &nbsp;that in similar chests. Some doubts remained, however, and a decision was made to remove the finished top. The two wide boards proved to be original, and the strip at the back appears to have been added to compensate for shrinkage, the correction of warp in the boards, and the possible tearing or splitting of the wood along the glue joint. Upon removal of the top, it was discovered that the maker, James Higgins, had signed the upper surface of the subtop twice in white chalk and included the date, 1789. 1 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Higgins (1766-1827) was about 23 years of age when he constructed this chest. The concealed location of the inscription implies that he was not his own master in 1789, but worked as a journeyman. The style of the chest and the competency of the work suggest that he served his apprenticeship with a master in the vicinity of Chatham Township (now East Hampton Township), Middlesex County, where he was born and raised, or in the neighboring community of Colchester, a regional center of the furniture-making trade. 2 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higgins married Lydia Smith, a daughter of a local family, in 1789 (or 1790, according to another source), as reported in the records of the First Congregational Church of Middle Haddam parish (later the Haddam Neck Congregational Church, after a relocation), and started a family that eventually numbered 11 children. In 1797 the cabinetmaker sold an 18-acre piece of land in Chatham to Lemuel Hedge, his brother-in-law, although a record of the original purchase of the property has not been located. Perhaps the land was a family homestead that devolved to Higgins and his siblings when they were orphaned in 1785 by the death of their father, Sylvanus Higgins. 3 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More certain evidence that James Higgins became a master with his own shop dates from March 27, 1799, when he purchased "one Certain piece of Land by the [Episcopal] Church in Middle Haddam," which was also bounded by "Land for the School House" and contained one acre and 20 square rods. The property probably was located near the Connecticut River, as the Episcopal church is said to have been erected at Middle Haddam Landing in 1786 or 1787. The grantor was one Jesse Higgins, probably James's first cousin (born 1776), who also was orphaned before reaching his majority. The land may have been that of Jesse's father, Jesse Higgins, Sr. (died 1778), who is said "to have held a small parcel of land in the parish of Middle Haddam" when he was not serving as a soldier. 4 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land records dating to the ten years that follow flesh out the picture. James Higgins's land bordered the Hebron and Middle Haddam turnpike, a 13 1/2-mile road that ran from the meeting house in Hebron to the landing on the Connecticut River at the village of Middle Haddam, a thoroughfare that probably established the course of the present Route 66. Structures on the property included a house, barn, and "Cabinet shop." A record dating from 1805 describes "the shop lot owned equally by me [James Higgins] and...Sylvester [Higgins]." Whether Sylvester was a participant in the actual operation of the shop is unclear. Two candidates emerge from the genealogical records: Sylvester (baptized 1773), a brother of James, occupation unknown; and Sylvester (b. 1776), a first cousin of James, occupation cabinetmaker and chairmaker. By 1807 Sylvester Higgins, the cousin, advertised from East Haddam, a community about 13 miles downstream from Middle Haddam. 5 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Higgins's residence in Chatham lasted only another two years, until 1809, when he sold "the lot, House & Shop on which I live" to Samuel R. Dickinson and Edmond Bolls (Bowles). Dickinson and Bowles can be identified as chairmakers; Bowles was also a cabinetmaker. Dickinson later worked in Middletown, perhaps as early as 1815. Bowles remained in Chatham on the land purchased from Higgins until his death in 1846. The property described at that time is the same, except for the addition of a "wood & wash house." 6 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Higgins and his family left Chatham for Hamilton, Madison County, in eastern central New York state sometime after the June 1809 sale of the Middle Haddam property and in time to be listed as New York residents in the federal census of 1810. An early settler of Hamilton, Higgins built a brick house and a cabinet shop on Madison Street. He later kept a hotel in East Hamilton, and at his death in 1827 he was the proprietor of a tannery in neighboring Earlville. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior parts of New York state, which were just being developed in the early 19th century, attracted many New Englanders. Higgins's cousin Sylvester worked briefly in Duanesburg, near Schenectady, but he did not enjoy the same success as James. He and his Connecticut partner, Samuel Silliman, erected a shop in 1804 where they produced tables, "buroes," desks, clock cases, and other furniture before trade stagnated, and they returned to Connecticut. 7 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten or more chests, including the Higgins one, are known in this distinctive blockfront style, with tall cabriole legs at the case front and high ogee-bracket feet at the back. With one exception, the scrolled front knee returns have the same profile from chest to chest, although the through-pierced scrolls of Winterthur's chest appear to have been less common than the blind scrolls of other chests. The front feet are precise in execution, with two-knuckle toes, squared ankle bases, and deep hollows emphasizing the sinews of the lower part of the legs. Drawer openings are beaded, a deep cove molding forms a cornice, and the edges of the top consist of a deep fillet, a flat projecting ogee, and a thumb-molded return. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest individuality in chest design occurs in the carved shells. Twenty-one lobes and flutes are common in the side shells, but as few as 19 and as many as 25 are also found. The central vertical lobe sometimes has an hourglass shape. Ten lobes are usual in the center shell, although one example has 11 slim lobes with tips that project farther than normal. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central figure of the shells is a cluster of gouge-formed petals on raised stems. Five is the common number of petals, but as many as seven occur. Occasionally, the center shell has more petals than the side ones. The center shell is further detailed by an inset border around the tips of the lobes. In half the chests, a second, outer arclike border is laid out in punchwork on the flat surface of the drawer beyond the lobes, as seen in this chest. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other chest of this type is known to be identified by maker or date. Several, however, have Connecticut family histories. One was purchased from the Post family of Haddam; another has a history in the Carew family of Norwich. A former owner of a third chest acquired the casepiece from a descendant of the presumed original owner, Thomas Harland, a silversmith and clockmaker who settled in Norwich in 1773 and died in 1807. 8 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antiquarian Frances Clary Morse owned Winterthur's chest of drawers at the beginning of the 20th century. She published an illustration of it in Furniture of the Olden Time and indicated that it had come from Colchester. In the mid-20th century, however, Israel Sack claimed that the chest actually was found in Wethersfield, presumably by a Mr. Maggott (probably Meggat), an undertaker, collector, and antiques dealer, who sold it to Morse for $85. 9 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of provenance suggests that the geographic boundaries of this type of chest are defined by the Connecticut Valley south of Hartford and the region eastward to Norwich. Stylistic evidence present in the Carew family chest reinforces this hypothesis. That case, which has the extra lobe in the center shell and the variant knee brackets, has unusual carved work in the front knees consisting of a grooved surface accented by a large volute. The decoration relates closely to carved work on a desk dated 1769 and documented to the Colchester cabinet shop of Benjamin Burnham (circa 1737-1773 or later). The two pieces of furniture further share a general relationship in the design of the front brackets and claw feet, and the desk is also supported on large ogee-bracket feet at the back, although they are not as high as those in the chest of drawers. 10 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still other furniture relates to this group of chests, including two chests-on-chests, one with tall cabriole feet at the front and ogee-bracket feet at the back, and another with four cabriole supports and a background history in Colchester. A tall, two-case blockfront bottle chest in the Winterthur collection has front and rear feet that are similar to those in the Higgins chest, and the knee brackets and shells are closely related. Through an ink inscription on the bottom, the bottle chest is associated with the Foote family, a name that was common in the Colchester area. There is also evidence in this group of shell-carved blockfront furniture of the unmistakable influence of Newport cabinetmaking associated with the Townsend-Goddard school. 11 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial dimensions of the ogee-bracket rear feet in this group of furniture are emphasized in a rear view of the Higgins chest. The triangular back footboards, planed on both faces, are secured with large dovetails and glueblocks. The case back consists of two 1 inches thick boards lapped horizontally and planed on both faces. The boards are slotted into grooves at the back of the side panels and nailed top and bottom with roseheads. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Higgins's shop site near the Connecticut River may have afforded him the opportunity to vend some of his furniture in the export trade to supplement local sales. Middletown, located a few miles upriver and a port of entry from 1795, was engaged in the coastal and Caribbean trades. By the late 18th century Middle Haddam had a developed landing, and shipbuilding and navigation were flourishing businesses for several decades. One of the principal entrepreneurs here was Jesse Hurd, who employed Edmond Bowles in 1817-18 to produce furniture, ranging from bedsteads and tables to bent-back Windsor chairs. In exchange Bowles received 658 feet of mahogany. Both Bowles and Samuel R. Dickinson worked for still other local businessmen. 12 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Higgins's removal to the interior of New York in 1809-10 may have been prompted by the availability of cheap land in that developing region. Almost certainly, economic conditions in Connecticut loomed large in the decision. National relations with Great Britain were deteriorating, and French spoliation was playing havoc with American shipping. The local economy, which relied heavily on the coastal and Caribbean trades, was already suffering when Higgins left Connecticut. 13 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long the cabinetmaker followed his trade in Madison County, New York, is unclear. At his death in 1827, the furniture and tools of the Hamilton shop remained: "1 Turning Lathe & Tools belonging to it"; "Cabinet Tools & 2 Table Benches"; "1 Box Stove & Pipe." The presence of "2 Table Frames" in the facility suggests that Higgins continued to make furniture on a part-time basis after he established other businesses. An intriguing entry among the household goods in his inventory is that for "2 old Bureaus." With nine children in tow, the family certainly carried some household furniture from Connecticut to New York state in 1809-10. 14 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is based in part on information in a comprehensive new catalog of the Winterthur collection of New England Queen Anne and Chippendale furniture, of which Nancy Goyne Evans is coauthor with Nancy E. Richards. The catalog will be available in September from the Winterthur Bookstore, Winterthur, DE 19735, phone (302) 888-4741</p>
