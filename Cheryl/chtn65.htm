Henry TOMLINSON</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Henry Tomlinson, with his wife Alice, and probably two or three children, came from Derby, in Derbyshire, England, to America, and in 1652, settled in Milford, New Haven, CT. &nbsp;What year he came or what ship he came in is unknown Tradition says he came to New Haven and thence to Milford.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From "Henry Tomlinson and his Descendants in America"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having settled in Milford, New Haven, CT, the next record shows Henry Tomlinson as "Keeper of the Ordinary" at Milford, to which position he was elected by the town, as one of its most honorable offices.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles of agreement could not have been very clear, for at the end of two years, "Henry Tomlinson propounded to the Court for the gift of a home lott near the water side to sit down in and improve his trade of weaving, which he is resolved to follow wherever he inhabits, which, according to his proposition to follow his trade of weaving, the to??no did grant him an acre lott before or against Easigues lott, out of the land reserved for elders, with this proviso, to follow his trade, and in case of removal from the plantation, he shall resign it to the town, they promising to give him the value of the same as two indifferent men shall Judge thereof."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a custom in all the plantations, if a family would settle to stay, to give them a home lot, and especially a person having a useful trade, and often further inducements were offered, as in this case, for seven days later the following record was made at Milford:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At General Court, Dec 16, 1652.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Henry Tomlinson hath taken the oath of fidelity, and also renewing his motion to the Court for some small accommodation of meadow, the Court gave him a piece of meadow in the Beavers pond meadow that was made use of by John Smith the last year, judged to be about three acres, more or less, on both sides the Creeke, for his incouragement to dwell and follow his trade amongst us according to his resolution therein."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it is expressly stated that he had taken the "oath of fidelity." &nbsp;That meant fidelity to the plantation under New Haven Colony, which oath secured all the rights of an inhabitant as to property and protection, but not the right to vote; to secure which in that Colony it was necessary to become a member of the Church. &nbsp;This he does not appear to have done, but afterwards united with the Church at Stratford.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomlinson claimed the house as his property, both Alexander Bryan, of whom the property was obtained, and the town disputed the claim. &nbsp;The matter was taken to the court, where it was amicably settled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Jun 13th, 1654, Henry Tomlinson, Ensign Alexander Bryan, and Mr. East were summoned before the court of New Haven for non-payment of duties on imported wines. &nbsp;The two latter paid their fines, but Henry Tomlinson made decided opposition, claiming that he had paid all legal duties, and under a legal process, caused the arrest of the Governor of the New Haven Colony, believing that the Governor was acting above all law. &nbsp;For this he was called before the court and fined one hundred pounds, which seems to have been only a show of honor for the Governor, as payment was never demanded.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of 1656, or the next spring, Henry Tomlinson removed with his family to Stratford, Fairfield, CT, and, on Apr 1, 1657, purchased of Joshua Atwater the estate which Mr. Atwater had bought of William Quenby, one of the original proprietors of the township.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1668, he and Joseph Hawley purchased a considerable tract of land in Derby, New Haven, CT, of the Indians, and this land in whole or part he gave to his son Jonas, who, with many of his descendants, resided on it for several generations.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1671, he and others purchased a large tract of land of the Indians at Weantinock, now New Milford, New Haven, CT, sufficient for a township, but his sons to whom he gave it never realized much from it because of trouble with the Indians and the General Court.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it known to all Christian people, Indians and others whom it may concern, that I Pocono, and Ringe, and Quoconoco, and Whim??a, who are right owners of one island in the great river Oantenock where Mr. Goodyear had a trading house, and also the lands on both sides of the river, we do by this present writing grant --- unto Henry Tomlinson of Stratford, the above mentioned island and the land on both sides of the river, three miles down the river south-east, and the land on both sides of the river upward north-west, which amounts to seven miles in length, and accordingly of three miles in breadth, which amounts to six miles in breadth; all which tract of land and island to have and hold --- &nbsp;&nbsp;We confess to have received one piece of cloth and other good pay to our satisfaction. &nbsp;<br>Apr 25, 1671.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POCONO, his mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OCOMUNHED, his mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WESONCO, his mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POMUNTOCK, his mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RIN??, his mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COS??USHAMOCK, his mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATARET, the Sachem's eldest son. &nbsp;TOMO, his mark, the second son of Maturet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUOCANOCO, his mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WEEKPENOS, his mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOTO, his mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOUEMAT, his mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHETEMHEHU, his mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OTHORON, his mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARISCOXAS, his mark."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record of the town meeting of Stratford, Fairfield, CT, for Jan 2, 1670, says: "Henry Tomlinson is chosen and desired to bee an ordinary keeper, ye which he accepts," and which he accepted several years.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Tomlinson d. at Stratford, Fairfield, CT, Mar 16, 1681, leaving a widow, two sons, and five dau.'s, all md. except Agur, his younger son. &nbsp;The remains were probably buried in the first burying ground adjoining the first meeting-house near Sandy-Hollow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his will, which is given below, the closing paragraph contains most beautiful and perfect commendation to his children, such as is seldom seen in a will.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Will of Henry Tomlinson copied from The Fairfield Probate Records.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mar 15, 1680-81.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of God Amen. &nbsp;I Henry Tomlinson of Stratford in the Co., of Fairfield and in the Colloney of CT being weak in body but I bless God for His mercy and goodness unto me. &nbsp;I am in good understanding. &nbsp;I doe make this my last will and Testament in mauer and form as followeth:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imp'mes. &nbsp;I give my soul into the hands of my Merciful Father Almighty God;

Phebe Worster the fifth year after our death, and to my dau. Bathshua the sixth year after our death. &nbsp;If any of these my children should be taken away by death before payment be made then it shall be to the children of the deceased. &nbsp;If God in his providence should take away my son Agur by death and leave no heirs or heir to inherit this land then it is my will it shall return to Jonas my sonn and his heirs to enjoy forever my sonn Jonas paying unto Margaret Harger my dau. twenty pounds the first year, and to my dau.

John Birdsey, Sen., in 1688. &nbsp;He d. Apr 4, 1690, age 74 yrs. &nbsp;She d. Jan 25, 1698, probably about 90 yrs. of age.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Tomlinson brought with him a "coat of arms" painted in colors according to the rules of heraldry, which is still preserved, and is in possession of Mrs. Catherine (Plant) Sterling, of Stratford, Fairfield, CT. This lady, whose mother was Catharine Tomlinson, had a copy of the original, some years ago, which she supposed was the original, and gave it to Mr. William Agur Tomlinson, of Kalamazoo, MI. &nbsp;Afterwards the present one came into her possession, which in itself, and by the family who preserved it, is known to be the original one brought by Henry Tomlinson to America. &nbsp;Of this "coat of arms" a print of a carefully executed engraving is presented as "Frontispiece" in this book. &nbsp;For further account of the Tomlinson coat-of-arms, see introductory pages of this book governor Gideon Tomlinson had also a copy of the original.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a William Tomlinson settled in Derby, New Haven, CT, in 1677, who, it has been said was a nephew, and came with Henry Tomlinson to this country, but of this there is room for doubt, since the will of Jonas Tomlinson shows William to have been b. in 1643, and, therefore, quite young when Henry came to Milford, New Haven, CT, in 1652. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This William, for aught that appears, may have been the son of Robert, of Milford, but if he was, it is a little strange that no records indicate that relation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a Robert Tomlinson in Milford, New Haven, CT., whose wife was dismissed from the church in that place in 1648, to unite with the church at Stratford, Fairfield, CT, who was among the original proprietors of the Twp. &nbsp;Henry Tomlinson moved to Milford, New Haven, CT in 1652.<br>Genealogy.com (LLC), Broderbund (FTJ), Vol. 02, Tree 3304.<br>Genealogy.com (LLC), Broderbund (FTJ), Vol. 68, Tree 0854.</p>
