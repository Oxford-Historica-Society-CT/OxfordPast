Eugene A. CHATFIELD</b></p>
<blockquote><p>EUGENE A. CHATFIELD (1841-1871): &nbsp;His will signed in New Haven, New Haven, CT bequeaths to "my wife Fannie J. Chatfield" &nbsp;--- &nbsp;"my mother Cynthia Chatfield" &nbsp;--- &nbsp;"my brother Wilbur F. Chatfield" --- &nbsp;and "that said executor shall hold said balance of my estate, for the benefit of any child or children". &nbsp;We must assume the dau. of Eugene, Nettie Eugene Chatfield, was not as yet b. when this document was written. &nbsp;The date of the said will eludes me at the time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enclosed within the legal document pertaining to the estate of E. A. Chatfield, we find that his Widow, Fannie J. Chatfield, signed yearly expense lists for the trust that was set up for the support of dau., Nettie Eugene Chatfield, through Aug of the year 1775. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the accounting for support of Nettie Eugene Chatfield for 1882 thru 1883 dated Jan 1, 1884,<br>we find that F. J. Dudley is the Guardian of Nettie, and also signed this accounting. &nbsp;Whereas the two signatures appear, (to the untrained eye), to be signed by the same person, can we assume that the Widow F. J. Chatfield md. before 1884 to a Mr. Dudley?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find in the record of the trust for the support of Nettie Eugene Chatfield "that Nettie E. Chatfield, the dau. of the deceased, has arrived at the age of twenty five (25) years, and is entitled under the will of said deceased, to the balance remaining of the trust fund held by me under the will of the deceased; &nbsp;I, therefore, render this my final account as Trustee under said will: &nbsp;John W. Alling, Trustee", Final amount paid to the dau. was $2,063.72. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this document we find "TO THE PROBATE COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAVEN: &nbsp;I have examined the accounts of John W. Alling, Trustee of the Estate of my father, Eugene A. Chatfield, and there has also been shown to me a copy of his final account as Trustee. &nbsp;The accounts are satisfactory to me, and I therefore waive any notice of a hearing of his final account as Trustee, and agree that such account may be approved by the Probate Court." &nbsp;signed Nettie E. Chatfield. &nbsp;"Received and accepted this 9th day of Oct, 1896." &nbsp;signed ?Livingston? W. ?Abarrland?, Judge.</p>
