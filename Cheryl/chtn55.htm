<blockquote><p>GEORGE CHATFIELD, I (1624-1671): &nbsp;He was b. in 1624 in England, and d. Jun 9, 1671 in Killingworth, Middlesex, CT. &nbsp;He was named in the wills of both his parents.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Chatfield, with brothers Thomas and Francis, left England and arrived in Guilford, CT in 1639. &nbsp;They were part of Rev. Henry Whitfield's Company and were Original Inhabitants of Guilford CT, where they appear on lists of Planters in Jun 1639 & 1650. &nbsp;&nbsp;"For twenty years Whitfield was a conforminst of the established church but through many of those years his home had been a place of refuge for the pious nonconformists. This ministry was viewed with disapproval by the reigning English hierarchy of the day as more and more restrictions were put upon the leaders of the Church. Those who did not obey the regulations handed down by the Archbishop were persecuted and chastised, sometimes to the point of imprisonment and even loss of life. When he was cited to appear before the High Commission Court and censured for his actions, Whitfield resigned his position in 1638 as head of the Ockley Church and made his plans to join others in emigrating to New England. Two of Whitfield's old friends had already settled plantations in CT. It was decided that the young families from Kent, Surrey and Sussex who had become followers of the Rev. Whitfield because their principles and opinions were similar to his own would also settle in this southern part of New England."..."The voyage on the ship "St. John", captained by a Mr. Richard Russell, was actually begun about May 20th." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Md. 1st Sarah Bishop in Mar 1656, dau. of John and Anne of Guilford, CT. &nbsp;She died childless in Sep 1657. &nbsp;His 2nd mg. was to Isabel Nettleton, dau of Samuel and Mary of Milford, New Haven, CT, on Mar 29, 1659.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1663 George and family move to Killingworth CT. &nbsp;George was one of the most prominent men of Killingworth. &nbsp;He held the office of constable. &nbsp;George and Sarah, his 1st wife, had no children.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chatfield Coat of Arms, granted 1564: &nbsp;Crest, an heraldic antelope's head, creased argent, Ducaly gorged or sable griffin on chevron of purple. &nbsp;Three scallop shells. &nbsp;Motto: &nbsp;Fidus ad Extremun, "Faithful to the End".<br>"Genealogical Research in England".<br>BY: &nbsp;Cheryl (Chatfield) Thompson.</p>
