George CHATFIELD</b></p>
<blockquote><p>George Chatfield, of South Mundham, Pagham, Sussex, England, was b. abt. 1566.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the will of his father in 1594 he received a share of his goods and by the will of his Uncle George Chatfield, 1599/1600, he received lands in Chichester, South Mundham in Pagham, and Oving.<br>Some of these land he and his wife, Margaret, alienated by fines in 1606 and 1609.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He probably;y gave property to his children in his lifetime, as at his death at Pagham in 1619 his inventory showed personal property of only &nbsp;L8. 8s. 4d. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration on the goods of George Chatfield of Pagham was granted Nov 13, 1619 to Margaret Chatfield, widow and relict. &nbsp;Inventory, L8. 8s. 4d. &nbsp;(Peculiar of Pagham and Tarring Deanery, Diary, 1614-1639, fo. 13.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he left no will, as no inquisition post Mortem was held on his estate, as the early registers and manor rolls of Pagham are lost, and as all other possible sources of information have been fruitlessly examined, positive proof has not been secured that Henry Chatfield who follows him in South Mundham in Pagham was his son; but the circumstantial evidence is such as to leave no reasonable doubt that this Henry was the son and heir of George.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He md. abt. 1588 Margaret (Mnu), who joined with him in conveyances by fines in 1606 and 1609, and administered his estate in 1619. &nbsp;They may have had several children born in Pagham, of whom no records exist, as the early registers of that Parish are lost.<br>"Genealogical Research in England".<br>By: &nbsp;Cheryl (Chatfield) Thompson.</p>
