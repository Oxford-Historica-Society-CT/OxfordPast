<blockquote><p>MARRIAGE NOTE:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaiah md. Grace in 1820 and both lived into the 1880's, with the info in his will listing his wife as Grace, I believe it is doubtful he married Mary Ann Holbrook -- See Isaiah's brother Bennett who md. Mary Ann Holbrook -- Nov 01, 1830 in Derby, New Haven, CT. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of Isaiah Chatfield:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second: &nbsp;I give unto my wife Grace Chatfield all the personal Estate of which I may die possessed to be her own forever, subject to the above bequest." &nbsp;(The above bequest referred to debts and funeral expenses.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third: &nbsp;I give unto my wife Grace Chatfield the use of all the real estate of which I may die possessed to use as her own for and during her natural wife."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourth: &nbsp;I give unto my dau. Caroline Lum, wife of William A. Lum and subject to the above bequests, one certain piece or tract of land known as Lake Meadow --- to be her own forever."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifth: &nbsp;I also give to my dau. Caroline Lum all the rest and remainder of my estate if any there be after paying to my son John Chatfield, One Dollar to be his own forever."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of Isaiah, from the Town of Oxford, New Haven, CT, dated Dec 12, 1874 indicates the same message in reference to their son John H. as the will of his wife. &nbsp;Was their a breach of affection between parents and their son John H. Chatfield? &nbsp;Or maybe he had already received his share? <br>BY: &nbsp;Cheryl (Chatfield) Thompson</p>
