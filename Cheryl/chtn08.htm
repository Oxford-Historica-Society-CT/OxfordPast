<blockquote><p>HISTORY OF PEORIA and STARK CO.'S IN ILLINOIS<br>ESSEX TOWNSHIP<br>Elected Sylvanus Moore, Greenleaf Smith and Benjamin Smith, trustees. Moses Boardman was elected in 1835. Madison Winn in his paper of 1886, says: “On the fourth day of July, 1834, the people came together for the purpose of building a school house.

Sabrina Chatfield, later Mrs. Hilliard, received $13.00 for a three months’ summer school in 1835, and Mary Lake $6.34 1-4 for six weeks’ teaching during the fall term.)

Sabrina Chatfield, better known as Grandmother Hilliard, of Lafayette, now taught, and was the first female teacher conducting a school in the county. Next were Jesse W. Heath, Mary Lake, Joseph R. Newton, William Samis and -----.</p>
