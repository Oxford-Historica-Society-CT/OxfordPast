Leonard Minor CURRY</b></p>
<blockquote><p>LEONARD MINERS CURRY (1867-1898): &nbsp;Leonard Miners Curry had very dark gray, almost light brown eyes and light brown hair. &nbsp;He went to school until he was between 16 and 17 years of age, and was then in the second grade in Lincoln Grammar School. &nbsp;He went though the second grade and then took a notion he wanted to learn printing. &nbsp;He worked at printing, with Mr. Brown, for several months but did not like printing as well as he thought he would. &nbsp;So his father got him a place with Mr. Hammond to learn watch making and jewelry repairing. &nbsp;He went to work with Mr., Hammond at #4 6th Street in Oct 1883.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard was named Leonard for his grandfather Kimball and Miners for Capt. Thomas Miners, his Grandmother Curry's sister Caroline's husband.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr. Hammond did not give Leonard as good a chance to learn the trade as he promised to,<br>his father took him away from him and got him a place with James Kite on Mission street in 1885.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard md. Mary Purdy who was b. in Jackson, Amador Co., CA. &nbsp;The wedding ceremony was performed by Rev. Dr. Case, pastor of the Central M.E. Church in San Francisco.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His death is not recorded and no information is available. &nbsp;On Aug 8, 1898 he was in Chicago, where an attorney, Morris Frisch, wrote to C. F. Curry saying his brother was attempting to get a rebate on a lost train ticket. &nbsp;He was never heard from afterwards. &nbsp;Disappeared after divorcing his wife. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His son was raised by his brother, Charles. &nbsp;Jack London was a family friend and offered to adopt the son. &nbsp;No other information on him.</p>
