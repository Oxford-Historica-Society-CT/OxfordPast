Their daugher Harriet married Stillman Cady Lee. They were grandparents to my grandmother, Winnie Vernette Bryan. I have a photo of Hulda, and an 1845 Hymn book, with the hand written names of Sabea Beebe Chatfield, Huldah Chatfield and Harriett Lake Lee. I also have old letters written to Isaac from his son John who was living in the Oregon Territory in 1854 and was going to California gold fields. I am searching for more information on John. I think perhaps he went to Montana.

Unfortunately it is worn and under a tree so its hard to get a good shot. I also took a picture of the Beecher Chatfield house when I was driving by. It is located on Chestnut Trill Hill Ext in Oxford, New Haven, CT. Our Grandparents Oliver & Abijah Chatfield both lived there. It is on the list of Historic Homes in Oxford. This is what is written up on it: Beecher-Chatfield House (1769) Oxford, New Haven, CT:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1768 Joseph Tuttle sold 97 acres of land to Isaac Beecher and according to the town's tax records, a &nbsp;house existed on this property the following year. The house remained &nbsp;property of the Beecher family until 1811. Between 1811 and 1816 John &nbsp;Riggs was the owner and then title was transferred to Abijah Chatfield. &nbsp;The house was owned by members of the Chatfield family until 1908.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't been doing much with the Genealogy lately my father is up visiting from Florida. On Monday we are going to take a trip to Jersey City, NJ where he grew up and look up some records etc. <br>Talk to you soon, Sue</p>
