        <blockquote><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farming was the main
            occupation in
            this section since the beginning, very early in the 17th
            century. The
            farmer raised most of what he required to eat. Coffee, tea,
            sugar,
            spices, cloth and the like, he got in exchange for the
            vegetables and
            meat he took to the village from Waterbury to Shelton. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheat, Rye and Buckwheat was raised in
            abundance.
            Grinding the grain was done in Oxford Center and Quaker
            farms. The
            whole process was in which the grain grew on your land to
            bread in your
            own kitchen. What a difference today. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to history, this place called
            Quakers
            Farm, came into existence about the year 1683. There were
            many
            disagreements on this section, but finally the transfer of
            Quakers Farm
            to one John Butler was settled on. Who the Quaker was, no
            one seemed to
            know. The record of the first child born in this place,
            carries the
            date of 1725 of John Griffin, born presumably in the old
            Griffin House,
            where Dytko now lives, at the corner of Park Road and Moose
            Hill Road. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1798, Oxford became a town, but
            previously, for
            over a hundred years, it was a part of Derby, and it seems
            odd to say
            now that to begin with Quakers Farm was the center of
            business in
            Oxford. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I forget, I will mention the
            severity of our
            winters from 1880 to 1902. Winter often began with snow on
            the ground
            and ice on the ponds before Thanksgiving and continued
            severe until
            around the first of March, when Spring was in the air. There
            was one
            exception. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The winter of '88 went along as it
            usually had until
            the second week of March. It snowed lightly for about two
            days, but on
            the third day it snowed harder and toward night the wind
            changed to the
            northeast and the Blizzard of March in 1888 was upon us.
            Never before,
            or since, has a winter storm been so severe to man and
            beast. Roads,
            bridges, fences and streams were obliterated from view. It
            was just one
            broad plane of solid white. Late May came and the drifts
            still showed
            on the north side of stone walls and buildings. The snow
            plough would
            have had a great time in this. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You all are, I am sure, familiar with the
            rains that
            came two thirds of a century later, washing away the bridges
            on Little
            River and the Eight Mile, with a loss of life and
            devastation
            unparalleled taking place on the Naugatuck River from
            Winsted to the
            Sound. Old man river has told us in the only way he knew
            "don't fence
            me in." <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many modes of life have passed away and
            new ones
            have taken their place. Railroads that ran close by are
            dwindling from
            the scene; the Trolleys have disappeared; the Horse and
            Buggy are no
            longer here and the sturdy Ox, that beast of burden so
            indispensable
            throughout all New England's history for the tasks he has
            performed,
            has gone. There was an animal well deserving of a statute to
            his
            memory. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The automobile, the truck, and the
            tractor, and huge
            monsters of iron and steel have changed the face of our
            world. Now we
            see man out in a plane, looking for a place to live on the
            Moon?</big></blockquote>
