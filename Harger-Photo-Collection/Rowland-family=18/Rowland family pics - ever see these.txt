Ed,

Attached is a PDF file with a bunch of photos taken by Alfred Harger of the Rowland family. Thought you might like to see them. If you want me to send them in JPG format for photo printing, let me know. The PDF includes the back of some of the photos which identify the people in the photo.

Enjoy! and have a great Thanksgiving feast.

Peace,

Dottie
