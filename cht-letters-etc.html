&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nov 27th 1861<br>
Dear Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought I would send you a few lines to
inform you where I was and what I was about.&nbsp; I am a Soldier
in defense of my Country at present at these Barracks.&nbsp; I enlisted
last Sept the 14th.&nbsp; I have been at Camp McClellan in Davenport
until about two weeks since we came down here.&nbsp; There is now about
30 thousand of us here in camp, including all there is about 6
Regiments
from Iowa here.&nbsp; We expect to march from here soon for Columbus,
Kentucky
or some other point we hardly know where.&nbsp; I left my family in
Wilton
and I should like it if you could manage to pay them a visit this
winter
some time and see how they are getting along.&nbsp; They would no doubt
like
to see you but they strictly forbid my writing to you about them when I
left,
but I thought best to write for your presents (presence) might cheer
them
up.&nbsp; Lib was rather opposed to my coming but I considered it my
duty
to come, whether it was or not I am not able to say, time will
determine
that.&nbsp; I am Sargent (Sergeant) of Cop. D of the 11th Regt. Col.
A.M.
Hair (Hare) of Muscatine, probably you know him, he that was Maj. Hair
(Hare).&nbsp; If you get this letter you must answer it the next mail
if
you possibly can.&nbsp; Go down and see how the affairs are getting
along
at Wilton, it would give me a great deal of ease for you know nothing
how
it worries me a thinking about their welfare and cheer them up for I
think
the war will soon close or it will be hard on the south. Secesh
(secessionists)
is on all sides of us here.&nbsp; Gen. Fremont left here yesterday, God
forbid that ever another as good man should leave under such
circumstances
as he did, the best commander that ever was west of the
Mississippi.&nbsp; Gen. Halack (Halleck) is now under command.&nbsp;
The Iowa 7th is in a bad condition, nearly all cut to pieces.&nbsp;
There is not enough of it left to make a good company.&nbsp; The 12th
is at your place yet I suppose.&nbsp; I left rather in confusion.&nbsp;
There was at that time talk of drafts and I dreaded that.&nbsp; If you
answer this I will write again soon and let
you know how we prosper, but do go down and see how they get along. I
am
not concerned but what they will have enough to eat but to cheer them
up
and see to things.&nbsp; It is getting late and time to crawl (under)
the
covers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yours truly<br>

will about Br Edwin's estate.&nbsp; The laws of Mass. give to the widow

to the heirs on the side of the husband.&nbsp; The use of one half of
that real estate the widow is to have as long as she lives.&nbsp; EDWIN
owned the mountain farm and the homestead farm which are to be sold by
the heirs, of which you, SARAH, HARRIET, MARY, LEVI, HELEN, and GEORGE

agreed
to employ an attorney in Pittsfield, by the name of "Bowerman" and have
procured a power of attorney, to put the business in his hands to sell
the
estate and settle it up.&nbsp; Before it can be done we must get your
consent
to the sale and your agreement to employ Mr. Bowerman.&nbsp; You will
have
to procure a power of attorney of the county clerk, or notary public,
or
some magistrate as one of the heirs and send it on to Lawyer Bowerman
of
Pittsfield, who has agreed to act for us.&nbsp; He is highly esteemed
as
the best man we can get to do the work.&nbsp; Edwin's widow stays yet
on
the old homestead but wants very much to have the farms sold as they
are running
down, the present state of concern, is, all are waiting to hear from
you
as the law requires agreement of all the heirs and particularily that
it
is their free will and act.&nbsp; These farms will for something,
possibly from seven to ten thousand dollars.&nbsp; One half of which
goes at once to the heirs, the other half to be deposited somewhere on
interest for the use of the widow.&nbsp; We hope you will see to this
matter immediately, for
it is kept back already by not learning your whereabouts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mary lives with us here on Long Island,
where I have been since 1851.&nbsp; We have six children, Frances A.
Seymour, Harriet F. Downs, Helen A. Terry, are each married and these
are their
married names.&nbsp; Frances and Helen live in Brooklyn and Harriet
lives
in Mattituck, Long Island.&nbsp; Charles, George and Edwin are our
boys.&nbsp;
Charles and Edwin are living in Brooklyn and George is studying to

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brownville July / 79<br>
Dear Mother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been up to NY and Hubert paid me the
amount due you, four hundred and 36 dollars and 90 cents.&nbsp; I saw
the receipts of E. Coffin her brother and all the rest of the
heirs.&nbsp; I can not see that he has kept any thing back, he was very
kind to me and so was Julia.&nbsp; He took me up the Hudson River where
his family were boarding and I stayed 4 days up there and Julia came
down with me to
go round with me while I did a little shopping, for things were dirt
cheap in the city as the season was well advanced.&nbsp; I saved a good
deal
on the price of things here.&nbsp; I got 3 ?combine? dresses for 7
dollars and a good common hat for <br>
?Linna? for 95 cents, the only hat she has had this
summer.&nbsp; H. paid all my expenses except my fare up there and back
and that was only 17 dollars.&nbsp; I had a real nice visit.&nbsp; His
children are very pious and the girls dress quite plain.&nbsp; He is
getting on well I think but Julia says about two years ago he came so
near going that he could not sleep nights.&nbsp; She says only the
closest management saved him from failing.&nbsp; They none of them have
good health.&nbsp; Edd's
wife is going to have another baby this month.&nbsp; She is older than
I
am and older than Edd.&nbsp; Her mother is married again and is
visiting
there at Edd's and her two sisters.&nbsp; They keep two girls.&nbsp;
They
wanted me to down to Connecticut.&nbsp; Sent for me but I could not
spare
either money or time.&nbsp; Hobart saw about my bonds and said the 3rd
man
he went to offered me 30 dollars for each $1000 bond but H. said , I of
course would not take it.&nbsp; He advised me to hold on to them.&nbsp;
He seems a very shrewd business man.&nbsp; I could not stand the city,
I
got diarhea while there, have not got over it yet.&nbsp; I want pure
air
and fresh food.&nbsp; Julia would like to move away from the
city.&nbsp;
She says H. is killing himself driving business, so she is anxious he
should
wind up and live in the country.&nbsp; Morton Judd has better health
than
any of them.&nbsp; He is adding to his house this summer.&nbsp; I have
put
the money in the bank I got there except the 30 odd dollars, I kept
that
out for I really needed it, but I can pay you it back if you say so and
if
you do not need the $400 I would be glad to borrow it for a year as I
have
run short by having to make repairs on this and the other hiuse and
will
have to sell another bond to meet my payments.&nbsp; I did nothing only
what was really necessary nothing for ornament or show.&nbsp; I thing
Hobart
will get Walter and maybe Ralph a situation or give one in his
establishment,
that will be a great favor if he does.&nbsp; Now summer is going,
winter
will soon be here.&nbsp; What are your plans for the winter?&nbsp; I
want
to help you and I think the l nd should be sold at a sacrifice even, as
you can not tend it properly.&nbsp; They will cheat a woman do the best
she will in farm property.&nbsp; I believe I told you I have rented the
Canada place for $2.00 (maybe $200.00) a year.&nbsp; Please write soon,
I want
to hear all your plans.&nbsp; Love to Father. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New Britain, April 2nd, '50<br>
Dear cousin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In compliance with your request as
well as my own wishes, I remit you a few lines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no apology to offer you for
not complying with your request sooner but an unaccountable
negligence.&nbsp; So pardon me Augusta and believe me not so
thoughtless although appearances would condemn me.&nbsp; But in answer
to your inquiries after the family generally.&nbsp; I would say they
are all well so far as I know.&nbsp; Grandmother is in Oxford with
Uncle Henry's people.&nbsp; Mother received a letter a short time since
from Elizabeth, she said she had just finished a letter to send home
and I suppose she wrote you all the news.&nbsp;
Lemuel the oldest of Uncle Albert's children is married and farming
it.&nbsp; I believe Henry is employed in railroad surveying.&nbsp; Jane
is married, her husband is a mason by trade.&nbsp; Albert and myself
are living at home yet and like to for the present.&nbsp; Neither of us
engaged in any business yet.&nbsp; I should be very happy indeed to
make another visit to the lovely west, as you term it, but shall not be
able to this spring.&nbsp; I was
in St. Louis one year ago and in New Orleans and Texas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Uncle ?G___?&nbsp; is in Annapolis, Park
County, Indiana.&nbsp; Uncle ?_____? is in St. Martinsville,
Louisiana.&nbsp; I stopped there on my way up the Red River to Texas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Augusta, my letter has been more lengthy
than I intended, and will close by requesting you to make my best
wishes acceptable to uncle William and aunt Sarah.&nbsp; My love to
yourself and may your dreams be as joyous as I would wish your fat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yours Affectionately<br>

My Dear Children\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I now sit down to write an answer to the
last received bearing date August 19th which was thankfully received as
we feel anxious for your welfare, we are glad to hear you are in
comfortable health and hope it may continue.&nbsp; This is the first

am sorry to hear it.&nbsp; I hope he will be better when col weather
comes,
but we must not set our hearts on anything.&nbsp; Our children are near
and dear to us but we can not keep them when they are called, we must
say,
"Thy will be done, not mine.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Heavenly Father."<br>

we can never see his face more.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><span

mourn his loss, his young companions seem to feel it much.&nbsp; We had
the

son give me thine heart.&nbsp; He spoke very feelingly to us all.&nbsp;
How suddenly he was called from earth and the uncertainty of all things

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is Sunday today and we have no church
and I improve a part of the time in conversing with you on paper.&nbsp;
I sit by the north window in the east room and it is a very pleasant
morning.&nbsp; We have a great many flowers in bloom in our dooryard
and cool shades.&nbsp; I think of the many blessings we have and try
to forget our sorrows, truly this is a mixt cup we drink on earth, we
rear families and they go out from us.&nbsp; It causes grief in the
parents
hearts to hear sad news from their children, it also rejoices them when
when they prosper.&nbsp; You write you are a doing well now.&nbsp; That
you are building a brick house near home.&nbsp; Have you moved from the
farm of your father or how comes it to be that you are building so near
your door?&nbsp; Is the building for yourself or not?&nbsp; We heard it
was from Mr. Dunbar's, <span

son.&nbsp; We do not understand how it
is.&nbsp;
Do not involve yourself in debt, keep clear of that as possible for it
would cause you trouble.&nbsp; Take care for the coming winter.&nbsp;
Have
a good cellar and store it well with things for your comfort and try to
go and see Mary, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 255);">(maybe
a reference to 1407)</span>, before winter, and see if
she is like to have things for her comfort.&nbsp; They have been sick
so
much and pay high rent.&nbsp; I am afraid how they will get along
through
the coming winter. Do not harbor any ill will towards them, be kind and
affectionate towards your brother and sister, and forgive if they have
done amiss.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sunday afternoon, I have been to take a
walk in the garden and see our vegetables.&nbsp; We have a very good
one for us, we have sweet corn and beans, a plenty beets, cucumbers,
squashes, seed pumpkins, and potatoes, but the potato not has commenced
rapidly, there has been a great many potatoes planted, but a
small yield, buckwheat looks well, corn likewise, also turnips, the hay
crop is light, oats are good, apples plenty.&nbsp; Your Uncle Chester

have done the farming, they have not hired a days work.&nbsp; We have
six
cows and six hogs.&nbsp; It is getting quite dry for the want of rain.
We
have had a great deal of rain through the month of July and the green
is much injured.&nbsp; It has been quite sickly at Seymour this
summer and a number of deaths.&nbsp; Doctor Stoddard's wife is dead, Mr
Mosier likewise, the others are strangers.&nbsp; There was nine deaths
in one week, but it has been very healthy in our town as yet.&nbsp; I
saw Mrs. Dunham last week, she was in good health with the rest
of the family.&nbsp; Pretsey Leeks health is improving, she was walking
down here today.&nbsp; Amanda is home, she is not able to do much, she
is going to return this week.&nbsp; Frank is not much better, he has

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Elizabeth be very careful about sitting
Fredy on a chamber if he has that weakness about him, it will make the

Stone, he told us to get iron filens and put lemon and a loaf sugar to
them and put them into sperrits and give it to her and it

My dear niece Nellie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your letter of Jan. 20th did not reach me
until Feb. 15th.&nbsp; Someone must have taken it from the post office
by mistake and carried it in their pocket ever since.&nbsp; It had been
opened.&nbsp; We found it at our front door before the postman had been
around that morning.&nbsp; I will make inquiry and find out if there is
another Emily C. Sperry in New Haven.&nbsp; I notice by the envelope it
was received in New Haven Jan. 27th.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, dear Nellie we were very glad to hear
once more from your family.&nbsp; The last letter we had received from
anyone was from Emma, June 3rd, 1894.&nbsp; I was negligent in
answering but finally sent her a letter, guess it might have been
months afterwards.&nbsp; In that letter I requested her to send me a
copy of the names of my father's family recorded in the family Bible of
Enos Chatfield.&nbsp; Your father being the eldest son felt he should
have the family Bible, so we gave
it to him. <br>

everything was at that time.&nbsp; I shall never forget the
faithfulness of your sister Lucy, while you folks lived in the cabin on
"Cedar Bottoms".&nbsp; I
thought she was so kind and competent to go ahead with the care of the
house and relieve her mother.&nbsp; Then again in 1884 we found her the
same helpful daughter in the home.&nbsp; My mother always said that
there
was a blessing to follow the child that was kind and obedient

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oxford&nbsp; June 8, 1864<br>
Dear Brother &amp; Sister<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have often thought but until this late
day have neglected to write you the sad and painful intelligence of
Mother's Death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For the past three years she has been
gradually fading in strength.&nbsp; Last fall and winter she had a
severe cough that weakened her fast.&nbsp; (She then thought herself
consumptive.)&nbsp; In February she was taken with the lung fever, and
something of the typhoid.&nbsp; She was confined to her room near two
months, and then seemed to gain very fast, and was soon around the
kitchen quite-smart for her two or
three weeks.&nbsp; She then commenced bloating very fast.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We sent again for Dr. Johnson and he then
called it dropsy, and a very difficult case.&nbsp; It was Monday
morn when Dr. came, and the next Saturday night we sent for him again,
and in so short a time she was pressed so full with water, that he was
obliged to draw it off by means of two incisions made in her bowels.
Dr.
drew only about three quarts, then it would not run, it seemed thick
and
clogged the tube, and he was obliged to give up and left the incisions
(which were about the size of a small nail head) open.&nbsp; Some three
quarts drained through each day for ten days, then it ceased
discharging
and she filled again but would not have another operation
performed.&nbsp;
If she had, it would done no good, only to as she said, "lengthen her
suffering
a few days longer".<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was just two weeks from the Saturday
night she was tapped until she died, which was May 21st.&nbsp; For the
last two weeks she was not conscious of much that was passing, we were
obliged to give stupefying things for she suffered great pain.&nbsp;
One of her limbs for a week before her last, burst and over one or two
cups of
water a day.&nbsp; That limb was mortified three or four days before
she
died.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She died very easy without a struggle for
the last twelve hours she lay asleep.&nbsp; It was impossible for us to
rouse her enough to speak or notice anything and in that way she
breathed her last.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The funeral was Monday after, she was
carried in the church and sermon preached but the coffin could not be
open there was quite a disappointment to many who wanted to see
her.&nbsp; (She had purged badly).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Five only of the nine of her children were
near to follow her remains to their resting place.&nbsp; Many times she
expressed a wish that she might see all her children that were far away
once more but that was not to be.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have her ambro type from which we are
going to have some photographs taken to send to the absent ones.&nbsp;
I think they will be done so I can send one in my next to you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two weeks before the death of mother,
Emily, was called back to New Haven to the death bed of Della.&nbsp;
One week before she left her at her Father Sperry's, to all appearances
well as usual.&nbsp; Two days after she was taken with
diphtheria, was sick only four days.&nbsp; Emily has had a double
affliction, she is to stay with us this summer, and expects Lucius in
the fall, her little boy is seven months and is a great deal of company
for her and us both.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We will send you a register with the two
deaths in.&nbsp; I presume you have not seen one in quite a
while,&nbsp; Heber is not home, works for Hat's, (maybe a reference to
Harriet's)
husband this year in the butchering business.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wales helps father on the farm.&nbsp; There
now is only four of our own family, something unusual for us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I shall expect to hear from you soon.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Family sends love.<br>

"His head was bundled up and he didn't see train."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The body of HEBER C. CHATFIELD, the man
who was struck and killed by the 3:14 train out of Seymour, Friday
afternoon, at Pines Bridge, was taken to Ward's morgue on Bank
Street.&nbsp; Owing to repairs being made on the bridge at Beacon
Falls, CHATFIELD,
who was a teamster in the employ of the Beach Manufacturing Co. was
obliged to drive to Pines Bridge to get to the depot.&nbsp; A steep
hill leads down to the tracks and CHATFIELD, who wore a woolen cap over
his ears, apparently did not hear the approaching train as he drove on
the tracks.&nbsp; The wagon was struck squarely in the center and
CHATFIELD, was thrown
violently to the ground, the shock killing him, as the engine did not
hit him."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Dr. F. B. Tuttle, of
Naugatuck,
viewed the remains as they lay in the depot and gave permission for
their
removal to Seymour.&nbsp; Undertaker Ward was sent for and brought the
body here.&nbsp; An examination of his person showed that the skull had
been literally crushed and broken bones were innumerable." &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "CHATFIELD was 49 years of age and
had a wife and children in Ansonia, CT, with whom he had not lived for
sometime.&nbsp; He also has a brother who resides on Chestnut Tree
Hill.&nbsp; He was a member of Morning Star Lodge, F. &amp; A.M. of
this place, and at one time was quite well known to this
vicinity.&nbsp; The
spot where he was killed is quite dangerous when trains are coming from
the
north, but approaching from the opposite direction there seems little
excuse
for a failure to observe it unless, as in the case of CHATFIELD, the
driver
of a team is so bundled up that the sound is partially excluded." &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "HEBER C. CHATFIELD, the victim of
the grade crossing accident in Beacon Falls, Friday last, was a native
and almost life long resident of Oxford.&nbsp; The funeral was held in
Ansonia, Sunday Afternoon." &nbsp;<br>
