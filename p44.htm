          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Parsons was paid $1 per day and his

          and lights. Kept 3 months. <br>

          Kept 3 1/2 months as known to your visitors. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Wheeler was paid $11 per month and
          board. Kept
          4 months. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ladies employed in the winter term
          continued 2,
          the term of five months; 5, a term of four months; and one 3
          1/2
          months. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; "Four boarded themselves, four others were
          boarded by the

          themselves
          were, one at $16 per month; 2 at $14 and one at $12. Of such

          mo,, one at $9 1/2, one at $9 and one at $8. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of the summer schools, as I have said, 12
          were in
          keeping. Only one, the 13th in Riggs Street was vacant.
          Because of the
          exceeding small number of scholars no school is or has been
          kept for
          several years. Females were employed in all but one, the 12th
          at
          Pleasant Vale. Mr. N.D. Hinman was employed to take the
          scholars of the
          district into his institute. He is paid $3 per week. His term
          is 23
          weeks. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; "The ladies who were employed continued a length
          of term -
          one for 4 months; one for 5 months; three for 5; five for 4,
          and one
          for 3 months. Five of these boarded themselves, vis. the 1st,
          2nd, 3rd,
          4th, &amp; 5th. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These five were paid - one $16, two, $10;
          one, $8;
          and one $6 per month, <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The other six lady teachers had their
          board in the
          district that employed them. The wages paid them being $5, $6,
          and $8
          per month. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The school houses, ...are in a comfortable
          condition. Mostly they are commodiously arranged and all as we
          find are
          adequate to the comfort and convenience required for the
          purpose of
          intended object. Some repairs have been done on the one in the
          8th
          District. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other than this there has been no change
          during the
          year for which we are reporting. As has been reported, we
          report, all
          schools are furnished with a blackboard on which are done
          exercises in
          the performance of arithmetic and algebraic solutions and also
          exercises in the study of geography, grammar and spelling -
          very
          favorably assisting the scholar in the onward progress.</big></p>
