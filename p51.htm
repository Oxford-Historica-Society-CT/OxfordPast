      <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><big>have 31 such
          persons. In that year Oxford ranked 40th in the
          state's 167 towns and cities in the percentage of average
          attendance in
          winter, as compared with the number enumerated. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The annual reports of the school visitors
          for the
          year 1881 show that most expenses incurred in each of the
          districts
          were for teachers wages, with a lesser amount spent on fuel
          and
          incidentals in each district. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas Osborn, of the district committee of
          the
          Center district, said of the condition of the school house,
          "In any
          other town in our State our School house would be considered
          poor. As
          our grandparents received their intellectual culture within
          its walls,
          it is reasonable to infer that our grand children may be
          compelled to
          pursue their studies inside the self same structure. It's
          location
          being on the bank of a stream, mud hole in front, no shade, no
          play
          grounds. School room low, poorly ventilated with scarcity of
          room for
          recitations. Reforms have been made from time to time, such as
          roofing,
          &amp; Etc., but repair all we will its the same old building
          still,
          with all its inconvenient surroundings. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That school district reported a total of
          $303.18,
          with 280 in teachers wages, $11.02 in fuel, $3.06 in repairing
          the
          school house and $11.10 in library and apparatus. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Center District was the only school
          reporting
          any expenditures other than wages, repairs and fuels,
          indicating that
          none of the other districts purchased books, maps or globes
          during that
          year. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repairs made during that year, within the
          13
          districts, were also made by the third, ninth, and tenth
          districts. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1885, the annual report urged that
          districts be
          consolidated, urging that only eight districts be kept. By the
          year
          1889, Dr. Barnes was severe in his criticism of the district
          schools
          and urged a take-over by the town. </big></p>
      <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
        <blockquote><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In most of the
            districts it is difficult to find any one who is willing to
            act as a
            District Committee, and those who act as such take but
            little interest
            in the schools. The school registers show no visits from any
            of them
            during the past year. Perhaps the better way would be to
            leave the
            whole matter of our schools in the hands of our school
            visitors and our
            selectmen. At present our committees only hire the teachers
            and procure
            the fuel. It seems as if these services could easily be
            performed by
            the joint board, and a saving of labor be made. A law
            tending toward
            consolidation was before the last legislature. We ought to
            hail any new
            method and be willing to attempt a trial of anything that
            promises good
            results, for we are, in our present indolent methods of
            doing, far from
            showing our children that the public is soon to look to
            them, or in
            impressing them that the public sentiment of the community
            will soon be
            reposed in them, and if it is to a healthy sentiment it must
            emanate
            from half trained or ignorant minds."</big></blockquote>
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state report published in 1890,
          lists
          Oxford as having 13 schools, with seven of them in poor
          condition, and
          only two of them having libraries. In those two libraries were
          a total
          of 40 books. The report lists the total enumeration at 248
          students,
          about 30 less than a decade prior to that date.<br>
