ABOUT SOME OF OXFORD's OLD LADIES

OXFORD Sept. 22 _ A peculiar coincidence occurred here seeral days ago. Without any prearranged plan and by chance simply, five widowed ladies all over 70 years of age, met on one of the Oxford streets, with also another lady not a widoe who was 78 years of age. Their neames were Mrs. Burrett Davis, 78; Mary Ann Thomas, 77, Ruth A. Peck, 76; Mary R. Osborn, 76; Hannah Hudson, 73, and Mary Lum, 71 years. The aggregate age of teh six was 451 years and their average ages 75 years and two months. Mrs. Hudson invited the whole party to her house for a tea party, when it was discovered that Mrs. Lum and Mrs. Thomas had attended school in Woodbridge together over fifty years ago and had never seen each other since.

The old ladies of Oxford are brave and vigorous too. A few days ago, Mrs. Almira French, 75 years old, who lives in the Tenth school district, saw a big snake coiled up on her front door step. She siezed a club, and sallying forth, killed the snake, which proved to be one of the dreaded flat headed adders, as big around as her wrist and the largest snake of the species ever seen in Oxford.
