I found an old news clipping of Oxford news. The clipping did not include a notation of the year. It would have to have been published some time between 1906 and 1014, the years the Rev. George J. Sutherland served at St. Peter's Episcopal Church, and also at the Quaker Farms church. I find another mention of the Village Improvement in an Evening Sentinel article in June, 1910.

(Karen A. Brozek: The article appeared in the Waterbury Republican on June 15, 1910. I have a microfilm screenshot in my Sutherland files).

Today's old photo is of Robert Hawkins from the family photo collection of Marilyn Stebar.
