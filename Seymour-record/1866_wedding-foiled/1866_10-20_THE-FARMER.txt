1866_10-20_THE-FARMER

Saturday, October 20

A gentlemanly appearing man and lady went to the Atlantic Hotel last evening. Their names were duly entered on the register "Thomas D. Leeds and wife" - and a room was assigned them. At the usual hour they retired. Nothing more was heard of seen of them till about 2 o'clock in the morning, when a policeman called at the hotel and made inquiries for a gentleman and lady, from Oxford, who had disappeared yesterday from that place under circumstances that caused suspicion that something was wrong. 

Under an impression that Mr. Leeds and wife might be the persons in question, they were awakened and called up. The result proved that the officer was on the right track. Leeds was charged with being a married man; this he stoutly denied, and resented -- but in the course of the discussion which warmly ensued on that point, he swore he never was married in his life, and here the debate on the question was ended by the officer, who placed both persons under arrest. Today they were sent back to Oxford each with a flea in both ears.
