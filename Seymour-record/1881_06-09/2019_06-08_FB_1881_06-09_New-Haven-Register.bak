Today's Old news is from the June 9, 1882 issue of the New Haven register. Our old photo shows Dr. John Lounsbury, who advertised spring water for health. Two other photos show the Hisorical Society's jug for Oxford Mineral Spring waters. It was sold in New Haven in the mid-1800's. Further reference to the spring can be found in the Litchfield-Hoyt History of the Town of Oxford, located at http://www.our-oxford.info/Books/Litchfield-Hoyt_History_of_Oxford/117.html
