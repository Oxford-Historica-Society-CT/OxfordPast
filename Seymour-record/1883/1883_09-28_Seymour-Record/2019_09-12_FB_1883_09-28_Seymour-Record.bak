1883_09-28_Seymour-Record

Today's Old News is from the September 28, 1883 issue of the Seymour Record. It details the results of the drought on the farmers and the community. It notes the failure of the apple crop in Quaker Farms. Apples were an important of Oxford agriculture. As late as the 1950's the Park Road Mill was producing apple cider. Today's old photo shows Joe Montriski's permit to manufacture and sell cider there.

SOUTHFORD.

The long continued drouth is a serious drawback to the farmers. The aftermath that they depend on for fall feed is not here. It must ineviablv raise the prices of butter and milk.

Leaves are falling prematurely on account of early frosts, and together with the cool nights make all nature seem wintry.

Two stages from this place to Seymour daily.

Erastus Burr and son are digging a well near their barn.

Mrs. Warren Stowe returned home last Saturday. She is in poor health.

Miss Ella Scott returned to her home in Hartford last week.

Charles Stone is taking apples at his cider mill in Southbury daily, also J. Wheeler of this place.

A few days since, as Mrs. E. J. Perry was passing from the door to the well she she stepped on some sharp object which penetrated her foot and broke off. Dr. Shove was telegraphed for and on his arrival he made an incision in her foot nearly two inches in length, and took out a piece of rusty metal nearly an inch long. The operation was necessarily a very painful one, but Mrs. Perry bore it bravely.


OXFORD.

The daughter of George R Baldwin was badly scalded one day last week.

Dr. Barnes had a call from a partridge last Monday morning, but his birdship knocked so hard for admittance that death ensued.

Eugene A Wyant of Seymour has purchased of D. T. Dunham the Allen place, on the east side of the river, in the lower part of the town.

Mrs. French, house keeper for Thos. W. Holbrook, was bitten in one arm by S. C. Wheeler's dog while passing along the highway last Monday morning.

Several schools commence next Monday. Fred. A. Bailey is teacher at the center and Miss Kittie Barnes of Ansonia at Red City. Miss Susan Tucker has already commenced teaching the Red Oak school.

The stage war is still raging and it is reported that the fare from Southford to Seymour was only ten cents on Wednesday. A free ride from Oxford may soon be expected. When there is a premium for passengers and dinner furnished in Seymour there may be business enough for two stages.


QUAKER FARMS.

The apple crop is a failure. Mr. Horace Hinman is somewdiat better.

Mrs. Bidwell contemplates moving to Bridgeport.

There will be a temperance meeting at Mr. H. E. Tomlinson's, Wednesday evening, October 10th. If unpleasant first fair evening.


SOUTHFORD.
Mrs. E. Wheeler is the recipient of a liberal gift from her son in New Haven, of a horse, harness, and carriage.

Mr. and Mrs. Fred Morris has returned from their wedding trip. Mrs. M. is expected to remain in Southford for the winter.

Arthur E. Curtiss, late of Naugatuck, has been called from West Troy, N. Y. to a position in Steinway's meat market in Ansonia.

When are we to hear the hum of the long promised grist mill? Many that now clinb the tedious bills to Olmstead's mill would rejoice to have the promise fulfilled.

Service is still held in the Chapel sabbath evenings. Could the two meetings that are held on the same evening be united it seems as though much more good might be accomplished.

The paper mill in this place is working but half time on account of low water, the supply from Quassapaug being exhausted. The water in the lake is lower than it has been for sixty years.

The proprietor of the store is hastening its completion. It will be a good thing for Southford and will keep at home much of the trade which now goes to a distance, as people here are disposed to encourage home enterprise.


SQUANTUCK.

The river has been very low for the past two weeks, not running over the dam except on Monday mornings.

Mr. Lester Whittier has taken Mrs. A. J. Downs' farm, and has moved in with his family. Mrs. Downs will board with them.

Mrs. Mary A. Stow from Pennsylvania has taken a part of Mrs. Blakeslee's house, and gone to housekeeping with her children.

The peach festival at J. W. Tomlinson's two weeks ago netted the Ladies' Aid Society nearly thirty dollars. They have managed in this way to raise money enough to carpet the main body of the church and painted the inside, both upstairs and down.  Mrs. Tolles has been untiring in her efforts to keep the church in good repair, and when she leaves us (which she is soon to do) we shall lose a kind neighbor and the church one of its main spokes, but may her usefulness still continue.

Mrs. D. B. Tolles was the recipient of a very pleasant surprise party on Wednesday evening. She was unexpectedly called from home in the afternoon and purposely detained until evening. On reaching home she found the house brilliantly illuminated and well filled with friends from far and near. The tables were already set and loaded down with the good things brought in by the visitors. Mrs. T. was presented by the people of Great Hill with a center table, with a handsome hanging lamp by her near neighbors, a handsome dinner set by her children, and a picture handsomely framed. Appropriate remarks were made by Rev. H. Q. Judd and Dr. A. Beardsley. The whole affair passed off pleasantly and was a merited expression of esteem and goodwill.
