OXFORD.

Mr. John Harder is very sick again.

The Red Oak School closes this week.

Communion in both the Episcopal and Congregational churches next Sunday, at St. Peters in the afternoon.

Mr. Sidney Downs had a paralytic shock last Saturday night, and is in an almost helpless condition.

Letters were remaining unclaimed in the post-office Dec. 1st, addressed to H. A. Davis, Geo. L. Moore, and Santa Claus.

The guild will meet on Saturday evening of this week at the residence of H. S. Hubbell.

Mrs. E. J. Alling returned on Tuesday from a visit for a week or more with her sons, Wilbur and Noyes, in Winsted and New Hartford.

The guild will give an entertainment in the vestibule of the Congregational church on Saturday evening, Dec. 15th. Admission 15 cts.—the proceeds to be used in starting a fund for a public library.

Mr. John Candee fell from the large beam of his barn last Sunday morning, a distance of 14 feet,striking on the floor but fortunately no bones were broken, the force of the fall being arrested no doubt by the bundle of oats and corn stalks which Mr. C. had in his hands.


The project of letting off the lower part of this town to Seymour is being considerably agitated. If our resources are to be farther crippled, why, then the dividing line might as well be at the centre, giving each the other adjoining towns a slice and thus wipe out the old town of Oxford entirely. But there are three parties besides those residents in that part of the town, which it is proposed to set off, which no doubt will have something to say regarding the matter, viz. the state of Connecticut and the towns of Seymour and Oxford. The latter certainly will.


SOUTHFORD.

The ladies of the Union Church will hold a box festival and entertainment at C. R. Oatman's on Thursday evening, Dec. 13th. The entertainment will be enlivened with music by Bradley's String Band. Should Thursday evening prove stormy the entertainment will be held on the first fair evening. A cordial invitation is extended to all.
