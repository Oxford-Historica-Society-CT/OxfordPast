OXFORD
Mrs. Orrin Tucker and F. C. Candee are both improving.

S. P. Sanford lost a valuable two-year old heifer the first of the week.

C. B. Perry is engaged in improving the exterior of Dr. Barnes' residence.

The bishop of this diocese postponed his intended visit here last week on account of the long absence of Rev. Mr. Bailey.

The Congregational Society are talking of building a parsonage, and are to hold a meeting to-day (Friday) to consider the practicability of the matter.

Webster Clark, of Zoar Bridge, has pitched his tent, or photograph car, on the lower green, where he will, for a few days, furnish pictures to all who desire, on very short notice.

Mr. Fred, and Miss Lois Lum have moved their effects to their home on Riggs street, and on Wednesday night the Oxford House staid alone for the first time in about two and one-half years.

After an absence of about thirty-two years, Henry A. Osborn is visiting the scenes of his early days in the east, with headquarters at his sister's, Mrs. Hayes, in Southbury. Mr. O. made a short call in town last week, and those who remember "Old Put" here hope he may find time to make a longer visit before his return, which will depend on the prospects for harvesting at his home in Turlock, Stanislaus county, California.

IN MEMORIAM
Lines on the death of Gideon Perry, formerly of Quaker Farms, Oxford, Conn.

Death, the reaper, passing on his way,
Reaps here and there a life from day to day.
Some, like grain just shooting from the ground, 
blasted by the frost of death is found.
Others, like grain that is not yet filled,
By death's dark shadow is forever stilled;
And some, like our good old friend, remain
Until cut down like full, well-ripened grain.


His life was measured - not by years alone-
But by his virtues, that to all were known. 
For over sixty years the path he tread 
And followed, wherein his precious Saviour led, 
Living a blameless life of four score years, 
Amid its joys and sorrows, its hopes and fears; 
Years of active life of work well done— 
Over four score years—and he the battle won.

But he is gone—has simply gone before— 
And journeyed onward to a brighter shore. 
Ready and willing, his soul could freely sing :
"Oh death, where is thy victory, Oh grave, thy sting?"
For while we here are dying hour by hour, 
He lives indeed beyond death's power-
Lives where the followers of God doth dwell-
Lives with him "Who doeth all things well." 

Oxford, April, 1883. E. J. Perry.
