On his return home last Monday evening, one of the voters who came "over the hills to the polls," realizing perhaps that he was a little deficient in the qualifications to intelligently exercise the elective franchise, stopped at the Riggs street school-house, and being in too much of a hurry to wait for the hour of school and the doors to be opened, made a forcible entrance through the window, taking with him sash and glass. He says he will pay the damages, and Mr. Thrall, the committee, thinks so too.
