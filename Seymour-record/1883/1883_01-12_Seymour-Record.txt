SOUTHFORD

We are glad to again hear the welcome sound of the steam whistle of the new paper mill. It reminds us of old times.

The trial of the highway case between the town of Southbury and Levi Scott before the superior cout in Waterbury last week, has ended. The judge returned a verdict for the town.

John Brennan shot a hen-hawk near his house last week while it was eating one of his chickens. The hen hawk measured four feet and one inch from top to tip of his wings.

Willie has got his new house completed and moved into it. George has recently got married and gone to keeping house, and we wish them much joy and a long and happy life.

The ladies have formed an aid society for the benefit of our little church and meet every two weeks. They meet on Friday, Jan. 5th, at the residence of Wales Curtiss. The weather was unfavorable, yet there was quite a gathering and they had a very pleasant time.
