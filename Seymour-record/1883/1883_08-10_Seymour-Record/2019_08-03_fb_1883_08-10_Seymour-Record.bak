Today's Old news is from the August 3, 1883 issue of the Seymour Record. The old photo of the H. E. Bidwell mill is from the Litchfield-Hoyt book, History of Oxford, Connecticut. The paper mentions the start of the legal fight over the man's estate.

At the annual meeting of the 1st school district last Saturday evening the officers were re-elected as follows: Clerk, Lewis Barnes; Committee, T. S. Osborn; Treas. Chas. H. Butler. The sentiment of the meeting was that school should commence the last week in September or the first in October.

St. Peter's church choir, having a small organ at their disposal, the music last Sunday was rendered from the body of the church near the chancel. The experiment was highly satisfactory to most, at least, of the congregation, and it is hoped that the many advantages will become as manifest to the choir and people that a permanent change will be made, and we believe that after a little while no one would desire a return to the gallery, a relic of antiquity.
