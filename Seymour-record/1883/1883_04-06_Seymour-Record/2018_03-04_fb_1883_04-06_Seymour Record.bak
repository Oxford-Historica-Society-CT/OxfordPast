Today's Old News is from from the April 6, 1883 issue of the Seymour Record. Does anybody have any idea what is meant by a "neck-tie arrangement" being featured at the Congregational Church social?

Teachers for the spring and summer sessions at 
the Riggs street school, Shrub Oak school, Red City school and the Chestnut-tree Hill School. Today's Old photos are of three of the schools. Each of these photos appear in the Historical Society's Historic Buildings of Oxford Past and Present. The Society is still looking to obtain a photo of the Red City School.

Timothy Condon has gone to Watertown to work for the summer.

Rev. Mr. Bailey, who has been absent since Easter Monday, is expected to be at his post again next Sunday.

The Congregational Social next week Thursday will include a neck-tie arrangement in addition to the usual supper.

Tickets for the chamber set to be drawn at the Grand Army Fair in Seymour, April 18th, are on sale at the post office.

An auction sale of household goods, farming implements, &c., will take place at the former residence of Benjamin Nichols on Saturday, April 14th.

Letters remaining unclaimed in the post office April 1st were addressed as follows: Mrs. Carry Peck, Mrs. Phoebe Warner, Mrs. Mathilda Titreau, Henrietta Wilbur, Mr. Theodore Allen and Albert Cushman.

Miss Linnie Andrews commenced the spring and summer term of the Riggs street school, and Miss Fannie Church of the Shrub Oak 10th district, last Monday. Miss Mary C. Hubbell will teach the Red City school and John S. Barnes on Chestnut-tree Hill, both to commence next Monday.

A special town meeting will be held next Monday, commencing at 1 p.m. to elect Selectmen in place of Messrs. Pope and Perkins, who have resigned, and caucuses for the nomination of candidates for both parties are called at the Town Hall Saturday evening. The Democrats at 7:30 and the Republicans at 8 o'clock. If either party nominates each a good man the nominations will be equivalent to an election, but should there be more than two candidates a little more interest may be manifested.

The removals have begun in earnest and within the next few days (weeks at the longest) changes will have taken place as follows; John B. Pope removes to Millville, town of Naugatuck; F. L. Davis to where Mr. Pope moves out; H. A. Lane to Mr. Davis' house; L. B. Perkins to Middletown; Lewis B. Hubbell to Mr. Perkins' place; S. E. Hubbell from Quaker Farms to the place which his brother Lewis vacates; Elizur Whitehead to Southbury; Wm. M. Hubbell to where Mr. W. has moved out;; F. A. Tucker in the house with his father-in-law, John Chatfield; Mrs. Northrop and daughter, Mrs. Lum , to where Mr. T. has occupied since last fall; Cyrus Hull and mother from Quaker Farms to Ansonia, their place to be occupied by Joel Ward of the town of Southbury; Samuel Tuttle to Southbury; Patrick O'Donovan to Naugatuck. Other changes are reported to be in contemplation, among them Chas. H. Lum, Selectman at Middlebury, expects to return to this town.
