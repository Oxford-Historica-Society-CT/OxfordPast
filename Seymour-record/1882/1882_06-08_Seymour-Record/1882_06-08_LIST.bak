Mr. Nehemiah Pope is quite low.

C. B. Perry and F. L. Curtiss are spreading paint for representative Bartlett a few days.

Fredrick Lum, who is employed in the restaurant at the depot in New Haven, is home for a few days recruit.

Rev. Mr. Payson of Ansonia officiated in the Congregational church last Sunday in exchange with Rev. Mr. Snow.

Oxford and Southford mixed nines played a game at Southford last Saturday, the former came out ahead 33 to 3.

Those that attended Prof. Russell's reading and recitation entertainment at Southford last Friday evening, felt well paid for going.

The people last Sunday were pleased with Rev. Mr. Potwine's two first sermons, especially that preached in the morning. The parish will not however be favored with his services many weeks, as he has concluded that he is needed more in teh missionary field of Oregon than here.

Burglars entered the residence of Mr. Scarritt at Towantic last Saturday night, and after helping themselves to some provisions, visited the depot, but we have not heard as any serious depredations were committed. It is reported however that a few days previous $11 was stolen from the drawer in the depot.

It is expected that Rev. O. H. White will occupy the pulpit of the Congregational church next Sabbath. Mr. White is the representative of the American Association and has recently returned from a trip to England in the interests of that society. At the close of the morning service a collection will be taken up in behalf of the Society.
