N. J. Botsford and wife and a Mr. Woodward who came to town for a pleasure trip last week, did not have a very pleasant season and returned to New York city on Monday.

John McCune, agent of the Mutual Union Telegraph Co., who has been stationed here for about a year, graduated in 1869 with honorable mention from schoolship St. Mary's, of which the unfortunate Lieut. DeLong was executive officer.

There will be a collection taken up at St. Peter's church next Sunday morning for the purpose of replenishing the Sunday school library. E. B. Treat and C. H. Butler will be pleased to receive contributions from any who may be interested, and are not in attendance next Sunday a.m.

A telegram was received Sunday noon announcing that on account of having a funeral to attend in Naugatuck, Rev. Mr. Gardener could not be at St. Peter's church as was expected, therefore the communion and baptismal service was necessarily postponed. Mr. Potwine officiated for the last time here as lay reader. Mr. Peck, lay reader at Broad Brook will come in exchange next Sunday. No definite arrangements have been made for services the following Sunday, but it is expected that the church will be closed in the morning. Mr. Potwine is to be ordained to the deaconate on the 31st in St., and if he accepts the call of the parish, will assume charge as rector-elect on the 9th Sunday after Trinity.

STATE LAW NOTICE: The Connecticut State law has just been amended by the House of Representatives so that women as well as men may vote on the election of trustees of Methodist churches. Meetings for such elections are to be held in January instead of September hereafter. The reason alleged is the insufficient attendance of male voters. We are told that it was at the request of Presiding Elder Hubbell of this district, but with all deference to his experience and good intentions, we doubt the desirability of the change. There is said to be one church in the state where this seemed to be a necessity, but the exception should not make the rule. Where is there reason for thinking that the ladies generally desired it, or will accept its provisions to any great extents It will be interesting to note the working of the new law.
