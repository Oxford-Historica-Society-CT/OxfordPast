Mrs. Hull exemplified in a high degree the virtues that mark the devoted wife, the self-denying mother, and the friendly neighbor.

Born and reared in the Church of England, she with her husband became a member of the Methodist church, but in Cedar Falls they joined the Congregational church in obedience to his leanings. Her religious faith was quiet, but satisfying To those who were failiar with her, she seemed to keep death always in view, manifesting a constant readiness to obey the summons. She was the subject of periodic attacks of sickness, from which she suffered much during her life. Her death cae swiftly. She returned from a visit to friends in the central part of the State on Saturday evening, and died on Tuesday night suddenly, the fmaily not entertaining any suspicion of her danger. Her disease was erysipelas and jaundice.
