ZOAR BRIDGE

The robins have returned to cheer us with their songs once more, but at this writing the north winds do most fiercely blow, and what will Poor Robin do now, poor thing, poor thing.

The river for the past month has been very high, owing to so much rain falling.

We have great reason to be thankful that the prevailing high winds have not proved so disastrous here as in so many other places

C. T. Sherwood took possession of the Zoar bridge and store the first of March and is getting his store will filled with supplies, so that the community bid fair to have all their needs in the line of groceries as well supplied by him as they were by his predecessor.

SOUTHFORD

The weather of late has been fine with the exception of some March wind and our farmers are looking for an early spring. As there is but little frost in the ground, some of them have already been talking about plowing, &c.

The work on the new paper mill is progressing finely. When completed it will be a large building and a great improvement to the place.

The business on the N.Y. and N.E. rail road is continually increasing. A large number of trains pass through this place both night and day. The brick for the new paper mill is left at our depot.
