Oxford.

49 dogs have been registered up to the 30th.

Michael Collins, harness maker has moved to Seymour.

A dog or some animal startled the people in the Centre about 1:30 o'clock Tuesday morning and by its terrific noise through the street, and frightened some lest it be that one of Barnum's animals were loose.

The selectmen were called to New Haven on Wednesday in relation to the new road matter over by the river. Evidently the town has got to come to time.

Rev. F. E. Snow preached a sermon last Sunday morning appropriate to the memorial season.

Mr. A. W. Burroughs of the junior class at Berkeley Divinity school read service in St. Peter's church last Sunday. Rev. W. E. Potwine will officiate next Sunday for the first time since being admitted to Holy orders.

Several got caught out in the shower last Sunday evening, some not returning till morning.

On Memorial Day, the attractions were at Ansonia, Seymour and Jumbo at Waterbury.

A good many of our residents patronized Barnum both at Danbury Monday and at Waterbury Tuesday.

M. J. Collins, harnessmaker, who has been located here about 5 years, moved his residence to Seymour Monday.

S. C. Wheeler, who has driven the long-familiar white horse on his meat wagon, now comes out with one of an entirely different color.

The copious rains have forced vegetation forward very fast, and potatoes have commenced to come up. So have the bugs in great plenty too.

There has been and is yet a few cases of scarlet fever in town. The family of O. C. Osborn who were badly afflicted with what the doctors called that disease, but by the family thought something else, have nearly recovered. Now a child of Geo. Andrews has it pretty bad.

A. W. Buroughs, Jr., a member of the Berkeley Divinity college at Middletown, and lay reader at Middlefield, officiated in St. Peter's church last Sunday in exchange with Rev. W. E. Potwine. 

Mr. Potwine is to officiate next Sunday, and will be heartily welcomed by his parishioners having been absent now two Sundays. His ordination to the diaconate takes place this week.
