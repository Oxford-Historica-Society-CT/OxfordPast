1884_07-11_SEYMOUR RECORD

OXORD
• Miss Emma B. Smith of New Haven is visiting in town.
• Rev. W. E. Potwine is expected to preach in St. Peter's church next Sunday afternoon.
• The ladies of St. Peter's church will meet with Mrs. Franklin Nichols, near Southford, next Thursday afternoon.
• Monday, the 7th, being the twenty-fifth birthday anniversary of Rev. Mr. Mohr, a goodly number of parishioners and friends gave him a surprise, and a very pleasant afternoon and evening was spent at the rectory.
• Marcus Flynn, the ten year old boy who accidentally shot himself in the groin July 4th, is quite comfortable and strong hopes are entertained of his recovery, although the doubt as to the course and location of the ball makes the result seem uncertain, perhaps as in the case of President Garfield. He is attended by Dr. Barnes.
• The frost which did so much damage throughout New England seems to have done less harm on our hills than in the valleys, notwithstanding the seemingly paradoxical statement that it was colder on the hills. For on Chestnut-tree hill ice was report half an inch thick, yet there and on Five Mile Hill many appletrees promise a good crop and small fruits will not be so scarce as at first supposed.

QUAKER FARMS
• A singular accident occured to Mrs. Bidwell on Sunday last. As she was walking inthe garden in the afternoon, without her spectacles, she saw what she supposed to be a wild vine wound about the stalk of a flowering shrub and pulled it off. It proved to be a snake which wound abut her wrist, and in her fright and efforts to get it off she dislocated her right hip and fell in a fright. She was attended by Dr. Pulford.
