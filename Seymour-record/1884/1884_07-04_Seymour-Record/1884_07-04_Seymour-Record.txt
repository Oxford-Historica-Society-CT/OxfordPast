Lively times here. The young men have organized a base ball club called the Riverside nine and they have fitted up a place on John Roswell's meadow, near the school house, where they played last Saturday with the steam sawmill boys from Little York. There was quite a contest, but the Riverside nine were defeated by a score of 49 to 40. They are to play again the 4th of July and have a picnic and a dance in the evening.
