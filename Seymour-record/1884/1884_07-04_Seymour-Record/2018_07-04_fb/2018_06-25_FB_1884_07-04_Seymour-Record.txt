July 4, 1884 Seymour Record

Today's Old News is from the July 4, 1884 issue of the Seymour Record. Today's Old photo is of the Sheldon Church Stagecoach which connected to the Oxford Stage and went to New Haven. Sheldon Church was the father of S. B. Church, the founder of the S. B. Church well-drilling firm and the owner of Oxfordshire. Today's Old News is about the Riverside Nine, an early Oxford Baseball team.  Today's new photo is a promotion for the Historical Society's upcoming Peach Festival. The Society asks that people who have photos from Oxford Sports teams, both adult and youth, to contact photos@oxford-historical-society.org to arrange to have the photos copied for display at the Peach Festival.


HULL'S HILL
Lively times here. The young men have organized a base ball club called the Riverside nine and they have fitted up a place on John Roswell's meadow, near the school house, where they played last Saturday with the steam sawmill boys from Little York. There was quite a contest, but the Riverside nine were defeated by a score of 49 to 40. They are to play again the 4th of July and have a picnic and a dance in the evening.
