Today's photo is of S. P. Sanford, who was the largest land-owner in Oxford. The mill which he purchased was located near the Oxford Road and the present-day Route 42.  The second photo is of the original Quaker Farms School. Originally built on the  east side of Quaker Farms Road  just north of Hogsback Road,  the building was moved  toward  Barry Road  after 1900  and  used by the  town  crew  as a  storage shed. After  the  roof collapsed from snow in February 1963,  the  town burned the building to demolish it. The school was replaced in 1911 by Quaker Farms School #2, which now serves as the Quaker Farms Fire Department headquarters.
