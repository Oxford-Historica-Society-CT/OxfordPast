Hinman
          the shoemaker; Hawkins and Meigs,
          farmers; Ben Nichols, Beach Downs, Sam Bassett, and many
          others amongst
          whom were Thomas Doolon, known as Whistling Tom; Ned
          Heffernan, Civil
          War Veteran and an excellent singer; and poor old John Fannin
          who could
          quote more history than anyone I ever heard. He could saw
          wood, thrash
          rye, pick corn and many other things. He became totally blind
          at the
          age of fourteen. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The places of interest are many, the most
          noteworthy
          of which is Pisgah Mountain. The eastern side of the hill is
          studded
          with a steep formation of rock and whose summit has many acres
          of level
          land. It is northwest of Quakers Farms. Standing in the middle
          of this
          plateau on a large shelf of rock and looking westward across
          the
          Housatonic River, one could see in days gone by, in full view,
          nearly
          all of Newtown. The growth of surrounding trees has shut out
          the view
          today. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The persons who gave the name to the
          mountain long
          ago, must have read the Bible, for in the Old Testament you
          will find a
          request made by Moses to his children to take him to the top
          of Mt.
          Pisgah so he could look across the River Jordan and see the
          Promised
          Land. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, an interesting place is on the
          eastern side of
          the Eight Mile Brook, below Quakers Farm, called Punkup. There
          survived
          until they died or moved away, the last segment of the
          Algonkin Indian.
          If one will search closely, he will find stone tiles and
          markings
          outlining his abode in this place. The highway running through
          this
          section has always been called Punkup Road. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a town meeting some years ago, a
          newcomer tried
          to have the name Punkup dropped, claiming it was a silly sort
          of name
          and should be changed. It is interesting to note how much of
          the
          Indian's land has been taken from them in exchange for a brass
          kettle
          and a few quarts of rum. But we still have Punkup with us and
          remember
          the Indians by it. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newgate is another section, the southern
          part of
          Pisgah, which derives its name from that infamous prison in
          England of
          long ago, where political prisoners were kept. The burned
          sections of
          the overhanging ledges still tell us that American prisoners
          were kept
          here during the Revolution and therefore the name Newgate was
          given to
          it and to the road that passes by to the south. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people in the past have been inclined
          to have
          the name of such places as Pisgah, Punkup and Newgate changed
          to some
          family name. They might as well ask us to forget the Bible,
          forget our
          sacrifice for freedom, forget the American Indian. We cannot
          do these
          things. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pass on to another little known place -
          Long View,
          north east on Pisgah, where a person on a clear day could look
          and see
          Long Island Sound. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree under which the Indian smoked his
          pipe of
          peace with the white man, long ago was the Old Oak Tree that
          stood on
          the hill by the side of the road a mile and a half south of
          Quaker
          Farm. It had been slowly bidding us farewell for several
          years. One by
          one, its limbs had fallen, until only one was left. That one
          also fell
          in a storm a few weeks ago. Only the short trunk is left. My
          father
          used to tell of seeing bear hanging on its limbs, back in
          1850, being
          skinned and cut up for the family's meat supply. The old tree
          has
          passed from the scene.</big></p>
