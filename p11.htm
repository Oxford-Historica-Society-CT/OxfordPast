          <p><big>as related by&nbsp;<a name="id4555"></a>Judge N. J.
              Wilcoxson.</big></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<a
                name="id9659"></a>Mr.
              Timothy
              Johnson related to me an incident that I must not omit to
              mention.
              The
              corps of which he was one, was on the bank of the Hudson,
              under Gen.
              Wayne, and in presence of Washington. Wayne besought
              Washington for a
              permit to lay siege to the British fortress on the bank of
              the Hudson
              called Stony Point. Wayne was refused permission. He
              besought a second
              time. Washington said the undertaking was too hazardous,
              it could not
              be successful, and refused him permission, believing it
              would be but a
              sacrifice of men, Wayne, nothing daunted, applied a third
              time to the
              Commander-in-Chief for his permit; told his plan and
              expressed his
              confidence of success. This he did with earnestness, such
              as told of
              the will to his purpose. Permission was granted him. He
              was allowed to
              pick his men. Timothy Johnson, my narrator, was one
              chosen, and as I
              think he said, his brother <a name="id4698"></a>Phineas
              was another. The men chosen, they
              marched onward to the onslaught. Washington re-viewed them
              as they
              passed -- he looked very sober, and thought they would all
              be killed.
              They were marched in to the enemy's picket. They halted.
              They were
              fast. Wayne came along with a piece of bread and meat in
              his hand,
              saying, "Blood may run in rivers; any one who desires it
              may leave the
              ranks and he should not be branded with cowardice." But
              one left. Wayne
              then went through the line of troops and took the flints
              from every
              gun, that there should not be a gun fired giving light for
              the enemy's
              aim. The night was densely dark. All made ready and about
              to commence
              the march. Wayne said, "Death to the man that attempts to
              leave or
              falters in duty." Onward they marched and soon came upon
              the enemy's
              picket. The picket hailed. No answer. He fired and ran.
              Wayne and his
              force ran after him, The fortress was encircled with the
              limbs of the
              apple trees piled high and thick, the twigs of which were
              sharpened to
              a point, so that it would be impossible to get over or
              break through. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But said Mr. Johnson, "We were so close
              upon the
              sentinel or picket, that he could not fill the gap made
              for him; we ran
              through the same and so entered the enclosure." <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy in the meantime kept up a
              brisk fire, but
              not a man was hit. They made up to the walls of the fort
              and set about
              scaling. The man first over the wall was killed, the only
              one lost of
              the detachment. The contest was sharp and and severe, but
              short. The
              British soldiery surrendered. Wayne received a severe
              wound with a
              cutlass over the eye, a cut in such a manner as to cause
              the eyelid to
              fall. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He bled like a butcher," as it was
              told to me.
              Wayne said that he would ever proud of carrying the scar
              of that wound. </big></p>
