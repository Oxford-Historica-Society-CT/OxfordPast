<div>Karen,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm in Detroit. Most of my ancestors are from CT - the pertinent
ones wandered to western New York and then on to Michigan.<br>
<br>
Below I have pasted a genealogy report which fills in some of your
holes - This is my direct line. I descend from Myron Walter Barnes and
Esther Riggs, so you can see why your website is so valuable to me. I
would love to have a copy of your database!<br>

<div>Notes for Jeremiah Riggs:</div>
<div>From Matt Adair &lt;mladair@gmail.com&gt;</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>We recently uncovered (what is left) of the headstone of Jeremiah
Riggs (1778 - 1858). He came to Michigan in the 1820's, settling first
in Grand Blanc, then moving to Fenton (both Genesee Co.) He was pretty
proiminant and instrumental in regional government and politics,
including the formation of the first Michigan State Constitution.</div>
<div>I have the following information from a genealogy here on
Ancestry: "He settles at Avon, NY where he built a grist and saw mill,
with cloth dressing and carding works attached. In this venture he
prospered for a good number of years.In the War of 1812 he was
commisary for Ball's regiment of mounted volunteers. He was next
appointed Judge of the Court of Common Pleas by Gov. Daniel D.
Tompkins. In 1838 he moved to Detroit, Mich and was appointed Master in
Chancery by Gov. Lewis Cass and for a time he was an overseer of Indian
affairs in that territory. He was a good writter on political questions
and a popular public speaker and was generally designated as "Judge
Riggs". He make his residence at Fenton, Mich and died there and was
buried with Masonic honors"</div>
<div>He married 3 times: 1. Lucy Peck; 2. Grace Bishop; 3. Mabel Kellog</div>
<div>What I am trying to determine is whether or not Jeremiah served in
the War of 1812. There is the reference above saying he served as the
Commisary in Ball's Mounted Regiment. I also have a comment in the
obituary of a grand-son which states he was a 'Colonel' during the war
of 1812. </div>
<div>My suspicions are that, if he served, it was with a NY unit.
However, I have not been able to find any "official" records that match
up. In fact, they only Jeremiah Riggs I've found in the war of 1812 is
from Massachusetts.</div>

born 1780 in Litchfield, Litchfield, Connecticut; died Bet. 1810 - 1817
in New York. She married Jonathon Hart Scott (Source: (1) <i>Researcher
Sherrie Haines (Barnes)</i>., (2) <i>BARBOUR: The Barbour Collection</i>.);
born 20 Jan 1780 in Farmington, Hartford, Connecticut.</div>
<div>Notes for Susan Riggs:</div>
<div>From Margaret Scott Stubblefield &lt;mstub46@hotmail.com&gt;</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Jonathan Hart Scott's first wife was Susanna/Susan Riggs b c. 1780
and died 1810-1817. She was the dau of Jeremiah Riggs and Anna Woodruff
from the Farmington Woodruffs. I found this by tracing the witnesses of
a deed in Livonia where she relinguished her dower. </div>
<div>Notes for Jonathon Hart Scott:</div>
<div>From Margaret Scott Stubblefield &lt;mstub46@hotmail.com&gt;</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Father Ezekiel b 26 Jun 1738 Farmington and d 28 Sep 1814,
probably Seneca, Ontario, NY. He married 23 Jun 1763 Catherine Miles,
not Mills, of the New Haven-Wallingford family. Ezekiel was the son of
Hezekiah Scott 1703-1765 and Mercy Harris. Hezekiah was the son of
Samuel Scott c. 1661-1745 and Mary Orvis, and Samuel was the son of the
immigrant Edmund 1611-1690 and Hannah Bird. In the Scott family, middle
names are often of friends and not relatives.</div>
<div>Jonathan was in the 1800 census of Farmington, with his father
Ezekiel. so he left Connecticut after that date. He or they lived in
Pittstown, Ontario, NY in 1802, and in Nov 1805 sold land there with
Susanna [as she signed it] relinquished her dower rights. Witnesses
were Jeremaih Riggs and Eldad Gibbs.</div>
<div>In 1810 he shows on the census of Dansville, Steuben Co, but he is
also listed in Caneades, Allegany Co. where he was 26-46 and wife Susan
was 16-26 with two sons under 10. </div>
<div>By 1817 Jonathan and a new wife, Catherine, were living in
Cobleskill, Schoharie Co. and in 1820 were in Charleston, Montgomery
Co. with 3 sons, including James, and a daughter. He had 3-4 more
children born there. </div>
<div>Jonathan disappears from the census before 1830. By then, his son
Genio was head of a family with two younger men in Root, Montgomery Co.
Two younger girls were sent to Seneca, Ontario, NY, where other
relatives lived, so the family broke up somehow.</div>
<div>Children</div>

<div>Notes for Ransom Riggs:</div>

<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Ransom Riggs (son of Jeremiah, 6 Ebenezer, 5 Ebenezer, 4 Samuel, 3
Edward, 2 Edward 1) was born in Litchfield, Conn., March 6, 1789, and
was married to Sarah Tremain at Yorktown, March 30, 1814: Sarah was
born in Massachusetts, June 30, 1795. Ransom was a hatter and cloth
dyer by trade, but being a man of superior mental force he became quite
noted as an exhorter and preacher in the Baptist Church As a
grand-daughter remarked, "He preached for the good of the cause and
worked for a living." In the spring of 1823 he built a raft at Olean,
N.Y., and floated down the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers to Indiana, the
State of his destination. After some unpleasant experiences with
malarial fevers, he settled on a farm in Johnson County, where they
lived the balance of their days. Sarah, the wife and mother, died
January 8,1863, and Ransom, the head of the Riggs family in all that
region, died of grief, January 16, 1863, and was buried by the side of
her he loved so well. Their children are as follows...</div>

<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Dear Children:</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">I once more take my pen to
inform you of my health and circumstances. My health is</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">good and my prospects you
will say Father thinks are flattering when I come to tell you</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">what they are unexpected to
you I presume but you know there is one who prepares our</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">hearts and directs our
steps. I will now inform you on the 10th of July, I gave my hand in</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Marriage to Mrs. Lucy
Palmeter, of Burlington aged 46 years.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">She is a woman of my highest
esteem and tenderest regard calculated I think to</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">render the evening of life
pleasant and agreeable.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">We commenced house keeping
August 1st. We live five miles from Plymouth</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">hollow on the turnpike to
Wolcottsville. Your Mother in law is an industrious, pleasant</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">and agreeable woman, one I
presume you would be pleased to call Mother.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Harvey (Riggs) thinks there
is nobody like her. He was up here yesterday to see us and</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">seemed pleased to think that
Father was placed in a situation to enjoy all this transitory</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">world had to bestow.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">We have enough of everything
to eat and drink. We have about a hundred wt. of</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">broad side pork, two half
lbs. of fish, butter and cheese hge and cake and I have just</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">bough a part of lamb, so we
are going to have a stue pye for supper.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Now what shall I say
expostulations and entreaties I find are useless but such are</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">my feelings that I cannot
forbear to intreat you to come and see.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Harvey says he thinks by
your letter that you have a desire to come down this fall</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">which gave animation to his
mind although the tears trickled down his checks when he</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">spoke of Esther "Mrs. M.W.
Barnes". I suppose you know that girl lies near his heart and lit tle
tommy "Barnes" yes all of you I cannot make no distinction for I
possess a parent's hear t. I know no odds</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">between Children and
Children in law and their children (Elizabeth excepted).</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Walter "Myron Walter Barnes"
I am speaking to you and not only you but all the rest of my ch ildren
to come and see for themselves, see how Father does, how he lives and
what a pleasant,</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">agreeable woman you have for
a Mother in law.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Well by this time you will
say Father has wrote enough of this stuff but suffer me a</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">little farther. I want to
have you tell Elizabeth that she must come down and live along</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">with Grandma.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Now I will turn your
attention to another subject entirely. I want to have you</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">write to me as soon as you
receive this and let me know what is your determination and</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">calculation and prospects
respecting your coming to Ct. this fall. If you should all live an d</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">have your healths do not say

<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">should feel disposed to do.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">I want to have you show this
letter to all the children and tell them that Father</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">wants to have them spend the

"Riggs"</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">and "Lot" Malloy to come and
see Father once more before I shall go to that journey from</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">whence I shall not return.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Tell them that it is an
overwhelming thought that I should never behold them again</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">in the flesh. I want to have
you look on the bright side of the cloud and not anticipate</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">something that there is no

<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">trust in the name of the
Lord and stay upon his God</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">I suppose you will all feel
anxious to see what Father has got for a wife but you do</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">not feel more anxious to see
her than I do to have you. You are not all strangers to the</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">scenes that I have had to
pass through. I was called to bear the yoke in my youth you</font></div>

<div>Avon, February 26th, 1865</div>
<div>Dear Friends</div>
<div>Mr. Wm. Search gave me a letter the other day, that he received
from you enquiring if he</div>
<div>knew anything of me or of my family and ??? I must write and let
you know that some of</div>
<div>us are still alive and in Avon. A year ago last fall we moved to
Pennsylvania, to live with</div>
<div>one of our sons (Edward) but, my wife did not like to live there,
so we came back here the</div>
<div>first of July, and shall probably stay here for the rest of our
lives. Our children are</div>
<div>scattered all over the country; James, Martha and the youngest son
in New York, Samuel</div>
<div>(if he is living) is in the Rebel army, Edward was drafted and
went into the employ of the</div>
<div>government in the construction corps, while John is at the bottom
of the sea, and Lankey</div>
<div>in his grave at New Lebanon. After I came back here, I went up to
work on the Valley</div>
<div>Canal repairing locks; and while I was gone my wife received a
letter from Williams son</div>
<div>George I think that is his name, but I am so careless about
answering letters, even to my</div>
<div>children that did not answer it. Elsie (Wolcott) married and moved
to Iowa and Mortimer's little</div>
<div>daughter Hattie went with her three years ago last fall. I saw Dea
Search yesterday, and</div>
<div>he wanted I should write you and send his love, and good wishes. I
had a letter from your</div>
<div>daughter a long time ago, but that fared like most others didn't
get any answer. Tell</div>
<div>Esther to write me, and I will try to do better by you all. Avon
February 26th 1865 Yours truly,</div>
<div>Love to all M.W. Riggs. All well.</div>

<div>A letter</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Naugatuck, Ct. Oct. 22, 1854</div>
<div>Dear Brother and Sister:</div>
<div>It is a long time since I have written to the west and I now
embrace this oportunity of</div>
<div>writing a few lines to you to let you know how we are situated and
what we are doing and</div>
<div>in the first place of will commence by leting you know that
Father, Mother, Joseph</div>
<div>Samuel, Isaac and Harvey have all gone to that bourn from whence
no traveler returns and</div>
<div>I am left along to tell thee I buried Harvey the 6th of last month
I went an stayd with and</div>
<div>took care of him almost two weeks but all to no purpus I could not
save him and with</div>
<div>shame I must confess have neglected to inform you of it until the
present time, But it is so</div>
<div>long since I have written a letter that it is a grate burden to me
to write, Harvey left a</div>
<div>feeble wife and three little children the oldes not eight years of
age and the youngest a</div>
<div>little boy about three</div>
<div>He talked quite hard of coming out West last spring and would have
come if I would have</div>
<div>come with him but I had not the means to come and he would not
leave me, so I think we</div>
<div>shall both have to Die in the walls of Bagdat, I should like to
see my remaining brother</div>
<div>and Sisters before I Die but it is altogether likely that I never
shall, unless they see fi t to</div>
<div>come an visit me for I have got to be so old and inferm and so
poor that it will be</div>
<div>impossible for me to visit them.</div>
<div>we are all well at present as usual but you know that Elizas
health is never vary good</div>
<div>Charles health is not very good Mary is a great straping Girl and
George Ellis and Harvey</div>
<div>are all well and smart, Harvey is at present our baby eight years
old last August, but we</div>
<div>had the misfortune one year ago this Day to bury our little
Caroline five years ole and it</div>
<div>made a dreadful rent in our family I assure you, but God will be
Done I should like to</div>
<div>have you inform Esther an Merritt of Harveys Death and our
circumstance and situation an</div>
<div>Write rite back to me and let me know how you all do and how you
are geting along all of</div>
<div>you and espesially your little Mary for I long to see her the most
of any body in this world,</div>
<div>and I want you to let me know where Merritt is and how he is
situated Write to Esther</div>
<div>and tell her I should like to have her Write to me and inform me
how she is situated and</div>
<div>her family, and I should like to hear from Merritt but I suppose I
never shall, but you are</div>
<div>so situated that I can hear from and see you occasionaly if you
feel disposed, nothing more</div>
<div>at presant, but Write as soon as you receve this, and come and see
me if you can</div>
<div>Yours till Death</div>

<div>Waterbury American Newspaper, January 26, 1882. The Riggs Trial.
The 'Palladium' says that Riggs looks much worse than he did when his
trial opened and sits in court in a languid manner and with a colorless
face. The anxiety of the trial is beginning to tell severely on him and
the haggard face of the gray haired man naturally excites the sympathy
of the spectators. The trial, excepting at times, is far from
interesting but the spectators seats have been well filled since the
beginning although on no occassion has there been a crowd. Riggs
finished his testimony Wednesday explaining that he cut his throat and
attempted to commit suicide in that way because he believed he had
killed Bunnell, and that to put himself out of the way would prevent
further trouble. Other witnesses who testified to threats against Riggs
made by Bunnell add to the fact that Mrs. Bunnell had said she hoped
her father would be hung, followed. George Riggs, the brother of the
murderer, and William B. Riggs, his father, were examined. The old man
testified that Bunnell told him on the day of the murder that if he
ever got the chance he would knock off the head of the prisoner. The
witness testified: "I said: "Rollin, don't do it; he's the father of
your wife and the grandfather of your children." In court Wednesday
were the parents of the murderer, the wife and son of the murdered man,
the brother of the murderer, and other relatives.</div>

<div>Copy of letter addressed to Mr. Myron W. Barnes, Leroy, Genesee
County, New York</div>
<div>single from: Wolcottville Febry 7th</div>
<div>Harwinton Feb 2, 1840</div>
<div>Dear Brother,</div>
<div>knowing that the Destinies of all us all is held in the hand of a
supreme Being and that he</div>
<div>knows all our thoughts better than we do ourselves and knowing
that it is our duty to act</div>
<div>by the rule or right and not deceive any one I want to ask you
whether you have, when</div>
<div>you have wrote to us wrote your feelings about coming to Ct. I
presume you will say you</div>
<div>have but I have some doubts about that for if you want to come I
do not see what there is</div>
<div>to hinder. I do not know but you think if you come back here you
will have father to take</div>
<div>care of but you need not trouble yourself any thing about that for
father is better off than</div>
<div>any of us for he has got his health and a smart woman to help him
and there is nothing to</div>
<div>hinder him from getting a good living.</div>
<div>I write to you to have your write to me and let me know whether
you ever intend</div>
<div>to come to this country, if you do I want to have you write when
you shall come and if not</div>
<div>I want to have you write how clocks sell in that part of the
country and how you will do if</div>
<div>I will send out some running parts and you case them. I can get
some parts for my work</div>
<div>this spring or some already finished off but I did not know which
would be the best way to</div>
<div>send the parts or send them finished and I want to have you write
and let me know which</div>
<div>would be the best way for I am a thinking some about coming out
there next fall if I can</div>
<div>send some clocks out there and have you sell them for me and pay
you for the trouble of</div>
<div>selling them for I think there is something to be made on them.</div>
<div>Clocks are in good demand here and they are a doing a good deal at
them now. I</div>
<div>can buy them for four dollars apiece and if you think you can sell
them so as to make any</div>
<div>thing on them I should like to send some out to you and have you
sell them and I will</div>
<div>come out next fall and see you and see if we cannot get something
for ourselves some time</div>
<div>or other and not always be so poor that we cant go alone.</div>
<div>If you had any notion about coming back to this country and wanted
to know any</div>
<div>thing about work here, I can tell you that clocks are in good
demand and you could get</div>
<div>work any where you was a mind to and get good wages. There is a
young man lives</div>
<div>about one mile from me that works at clocks all the time. He busy
the running parts and</div>
<div>cases them himself and makes money by it. He told me the other day
that he was drove to</div>
<div>death for clocks. He said he could not finish off as fast as they
wanted them. If I come</div>
<div>out there next fall I shall continue to get a pair of trunks and
get them filled with goods</div>
<div>and peddle out there and back again so I need not lose my journey
and go for nothing.</div>
<div>If you calculate to come back this spring I want to have you write
to me</div>
<div>immediately and write just as you mean to do so I can make
calculations about the clocks.</div>
<div>I have wrote about that all I want to so I will write about
something else. We are</div>
<div>all well but not much to do this winter for the snow in this part
of the country is three fee t</div>
<div>deep on the level and people cannot get about much to bring any
work for me to do but I</div>
<div>have got provisions enough to last my family through this winter
if I do not do any thing.</div>
<div>Fathers family are well and the Old man enjoys himself pretty
well. Harvey lives in</div>
<div>Waterbury and works in the Button factory and haves nineteen
dollars and a half a month</div>
<div>and bids fair to make a smart likely man. He works steady and
faithful and they like him</div>
<div>very much and would not let him go away on no consideration at
all. as it respects your</div>
<div>fathers family I do not know any thing about them only I heard
from Ebrun's folks last fall</div>
<div>and they were all sick at that time and I have not heard any thing
from them since. I want</div>
<div>to have you write how you think german silver spoons will go out
there for if I come out</div>
<div>there next fall I intend to bring some if you think I can sell
them to make any profit on</div>
<div>them. I can buy them here for two dollars and a quarter a doze,
and I want to have you</div>
<div>write whether I can make any thing or not.</div>
<div>Now I will tell you what I want to have you do, I want to have you
if you will</div>
<div>come down to this country and go to work at clocks and I will go
to work with you. We</div>
<div>can make the cases and buy the running parts and finish them off
in good style and we can</div>
<div>make money on them. We can hire a shop here where I live. There is
a good water wheel</div>
<div>and water enough and right on the turnpike from Woolcottsville to
Waterbury and wood</div>
<div>plenty and a large house and a good one and can make bedsteads and
some cabinet if we</div>
<div>are a mind to.</div>
<div>I do not know but you will think that I have wrote enough of this
foolish stuff but I</div>
<div>write just as I think for I do believe we might do well. I want to
have you consider this</div>
<div>and then make up your mind and then write me an answer, Amen,</div>
<div>I.W.R.</div>
<div>Give our respects all enquiring friends.</div>
<div>I should like to see you all, but the lord only knows when.</div>
<div>I remain your sincere friend and Brother,</div>

<div>A letter</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Waterbury, Conn</div>
<div>July 9 1839</div>
<div>Dear Brother and Sister,</div>
<div>I now have a few leisure moments which I am very happy to spend in
writing a few lines</div>
<div>to you to let you know my present situation likewise my future
calculations. I am now at</div>
<div>work in the Button Factory at Waterville formerly called
Haydensville for Ives Hendrick &amp;</div>
<div>Co at seventy five cents per day and Board, and shall in all
probability continue untill the</div>
<div>first of March if not a year at the same price and if the man that
I am to work with does as</div>
<div>he talks of I can within the course of a year get a dollar and a
half a day I work at casting</div>
<div>and rolling and he says if the Co, is willing he will learn me all
he can and give it up to me</div>
<div>as soon as the first of March I have not spoken to Mr. Hendrick
yet, but I intend to soon</div>
<div>and I think it very probable that he will let me do it, I board
with Austin Painter as I have</div>
<div>done for seven months past and enjoy comfortable health and a
comfortable living I have</div>
<div>nothing more in particular to write concerning myself only give my
best love to Esther and</div>
<div>the children likewise to all the family especially Marcia and her
little girl and dont forget</div>
<div>Lot, kiss them dear little children once for me and tell Marcie to
do me the same kindness</div>
<div>I heard from father about a week ago and he was well and was
getting shingles in</div>
<div>Harwinton, he had got a couple of half barrels of fish ???? which
I expect he is keeping</div>
<div>one certain for you. Isaac lives in Winchester I believe but I
have not seen him in about</div>
<div>six months but the last I heard from Wm he was well and his family
they have two children</div>
<div>as I suppose you have heard before Father you know has got to be
an old gray bearded</div>
<div>man and we must not say by him as the song says poor old horse let
him die we must</div>
<div>respect our father and take good care of him and be a comfort to
him in his old age and</div>
<div>the Lord will reward us it has now got to be 10 o'clock and I must
retire to rest if God</div>
<div>grants I will finish my letter tomorrow so good night.</div>
<div>Father send me a letter last spring that he received from you
stating that you was coming</div>
<div>down here this summer on a visit if you did not move your family
down of which I was</div>
<div>very much pleased to hear but I should be much more so to have you
bring them too for I</div>
<div>want to see them two little children I want to see little Tommy
very much but I think that</div>
<div>Eliby seems rather nearer to me that he does because I have lived
with her so much,</div>
<div>however I dont intend to show any partiality between them nor
between them and</div>
<div>Marcie's little Mary, for I want to see her as much as any one and
tell them all that uncle</div>
<div>Harvey wants to see them very much and tell that the same for
Grampa tell Eliza that she</div>
<div>must be a good girl mind her parents learn her Book well and if I
every see them I will</div>
<div>give her and little Mary each of them a new bonnet and little
Tommy, a new cap, I want to</div>
<div>have you tell Marcia that I want to see her and Lot very much
indeed I want to see Lot</div>
<div>for I want to pay him for the trouble that I made him when I was
sick there and tell them</div>
<div>both they must write to me immediately and let me know where they
are and how they get</div>
<div>along and I will write to them. I know nothing but what Father and
Isaac and his family</div>
<div>are well and respecting your fathers family I have not heard from
them in some time but</div>
<div>the last I heard from them they were all well. I was to have you
and Esther write to me</div>
<div>immediately and whether you intend to come down here this fall or
not and I hope you</div>
<div>will come. Give my best love to all enquireing friends especially
to mother Pratt, write as</div>
<div>soon as you receive this. I must now close my letter and may the
blessings of heaven rest</div>
<div>on you all now henceforth and forever, please to excuse a poor pen
poor paper and poor</div>
<div>writing, yours till death.</div>

<div>Another letter</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>addressed to Mr. Myron W. Barnes, Meridian, Sanford Post Office,
Ingham</div>
<div>County, Michigan</div>
<div>New Haven, Ct.</div>
<div>June 23, 1850</div>
<div>Dear Brother and Sister,</div>
<div>I have been negligent for reasons I know not what but I have had
trouble upon</div>
<div>trouble heaped upon me until it seems as though I didn't know what
to do with myself but</div>
<div>I am alive yet and kicking.</div>
<div>I have a great deal to say to you but I don't know where to begin
or what to say</div>
<div>first. I suppose however that you would like to hear the
particulars concerning Fathers</div>
<div>and Isaacs death and also uncle Josiah Rigby and his wife and
Laura Upson, uncle John</div>
<div>Rigbys youngest daughter making five in all of our relatives that
have died within two</div>
<div>years.</div>
<div>Father the first and Laura the last being about two years
difference in their deaths.</div>
<div>Fathers health was better after he came back from the west but he
had several severe fits</div>
<div>of sickness and got diseased all over so that he was completely
broke to pieces and finally</div>
<div>died of disease of the heart. He was very much distressed in the
last stages of life and lay</div>
<div>in a dying state about three hours and I presume a person could
have heard him breathe a</div>
<div>doz rods from the house. Esther you can think what my feelings
were but you can't know</div>
<div>them neither can I tell you and then to be taken immediately from
that to the whole care of</div>
<div>Isaac on a bed of sickness of six months duration and then to be
separated from him was</div>
<div>seemingly more than I could bear for sometimes it seemed as though
I should sink into the</div>
<div>earth the circumstances that Isaac's sickness placed him in was a
sourse of grief to him and</div>
<div>I think aggravated his disease for such work as some folks tried
to make was enough to</div>
<div>break the heart of a stone and I had them all to fight but I got
through with it and they</div>
<div>didn't get him to the poor house either.</div>
<div>Isaac says in his last hours, I thank God I have one brother that
is a brother. The</div>
<div>town of Oxford took Edward and put him out and Ann took charge of
Eliza and I haven't</div>
<div>heard direct from them in over a year.</div>
<div>Isaac's disease terminated in consumption, he died very easy and
reconciled</div>
<div>compared with what he had to undergo.</div>
<div>Uncle Josiah Ribgy and his wife both died last summer of dysentery
just a weeks</div>
<div>difference in their deaths and Laura died this spring of
consumption. I have no near</div>
<div>relatives near me now except Williams and his family and they live
up in Guntown, so</div>
<div>called. Eliza was at my house a few days since she said they were
all well as usual.</div>
<div>William grows old but about the same old six pence they have six
children and in rather</div>
<div>embarrassed circumstances but however they get along very well and
get a very good</div>
<div>living I believe. William keeps out of debt and that is certainly
a good thing for any man</div>
<div>but as for ourselves we are about as good as two and sixpence have
young ones as fast as</div>
<div>rabbits and that is about all we do have only we have to work
prodigous hard to take care</div>
<div>of them we have got two already and before you know it we shall
have more. We are</div>
<div>going to have a great time here the fourth and I wish you was here
to enjoy it with us also</div>
<div>the advantages of the salt water that we can have but we don't
improve it very often. I</div>
<div>work in Waterbury last year six or seven months on a hours for
Philo Brown Esq. The</div>
<div>joiner work cost between seven and eight thousand dollars.</div>
<div>You would hardly know you was to go to Waterbury now, you stand on
west side</div>
<div>hill and look on to it and it looks like a city. I was past the
place that used to be our ho me</div>
<div>last summer and my feelings were better felt than described. the
place looked very natural</div>
<div>but our friends I thought where are they. the thought was too much
for me. Only one</div>
<div>brother left with me, both sisters absent from me, Father, mother
and three brothers gone</div>
<div>the way of all the earth, us respecting our stepmother. I believe
she took very good care</div>
<div>of Father when he was sick but aside from that I haven't much to
say for her therefore I</div>
<div>wont say anything about her. She caused Father a great deal of
trouble say nothing about</div>
<div>myself and then to get rid of her I gave her every thing that
belonged to Father that she</div>
<div>and her daughter hadn't stole, she and her son in law agreeing to
pay what few debts there</div>
<div>were but I have since had five dollars to pay that belonged to
them to pay, but enough of</div>
<div>this for I don't want to think of it at all. I have had so much
trouble and some sickness</div>
<div>that my constitution is pretty much broken down but my health
appears to be rather better</div>
<div>this summer than usual. Thus far Harriet's health is not very good
for her although she is</div>
<div>never very rugged.</div>
<div>I work at joinering here and can get a very good living but that
is about all</div>
<div>although wages are $1.50 per day yet every thing is so high here
that it takes most of</div>
<div>about all I can earn to live. I believe I have nothing more of
importance to write only I</div>
<div>wish you to write to me as soon as you receive this and write all
about your affairs how</div>
<div>you get along and all about Elizabeth and her husband and all
about the children. Our</div>
<div>children's names are Georgianna, Amelia, Grace and Ella. So good
bye, Yours res.,</div>

<div>Notes for Esther Riggs*:</div>
<div>It is not clear if Catherine Shaw or Betsey Rigby is Esther's
mother.</div>
<div>From Letters of Daniel Alonzo Nash</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>In those days envelopes were unknown and letters were written and
brought to the office. The Post Master would fold the letter into
compact form and seal it with sealing wax. </div>
<div>The following is written on a legal size sheet of paper:</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Conflice with Sin (no date)</div>
<div>1. Ah! when shall I be free from sinning,</div>
<div>And from wrong affections, free?</div>
<div>When, the victory full winning,</div>
<div>Be well pleasing, Lord to thee.</div>
<div>I have still to own, with weeping,</div>
<div>Sin his watch within is keeping,</div>
<div>Still, full oft, with efforts strong,</div>
<div>Urges me to do the wrong.</div>
<div>2. Yet, in time of my devotions,</div>
<div>Musing on thy sacred word,</div>
<div>I have felt those sweet emotions,</div>
<div>Which to saints their blifs afford:</div>
<div>Then I prized this holy pleasure</div>
<div>Far above all worldly treasure,</div>
<div>Wish'd a heart entirely thine,</div>
<div>Warm with virtue all divine.</div>
<div>3. Then, too, vowed - full purpose making</div>
<div>That I only thine would be:</div>
<div>And, my inmost powers awking,</div>
<div>From all evil would be free;</div>
<div>To thee all my service giving,</div>
<div>To thy glory only living,</div>
<div>Sin, in all its forms, would shun,</div>
<div>And the ways of God would run.</div>
<div>4. But alas! too soon, exerting</div>
<div>Hidden power, some pafsion rose,</div>
<div>Marring, hind'ring, disconcerting,</div>
<div>Every good I might propose:</div>
<div>Lures to pleasure, fears, and troubles,</div>
<div>Ill examples, cheating bubbles,</div>
<div>There on every side assail.</div>
<div>And my schemes of goodnefs fail.</div>
<div>5. Wretched man! - from evil turning.</div>
<div>Vain my utmost strength appears;</div>
<div>Then, with deepest sorrow mourning,</div>
<div>Fruitlefs, too, are all my tears:</div>
<div>Still my heart with sin is teeming -</div>
<div>Is there none from sin redeeming?</div>
<div>Thanks! - My God, thro' Christ, will free</div>
<div>From this load of misery.</div>
<div>6. Thou forgivest, God of mercies,</div>
<div>Those who against their errors strive;</div>
<div>They alone shall bear thy curses</div>
<div>Who in sin consent to live:</div>
<div>May I not then hope for pardon,</div>
<div>While I feel my sins a burden?</div>
<div>Trusting to thy gracious care,</div>
<div>Can I yield me to despair?</div>
<div>7. Since, while I am here remaining</div>
<div>Sin will new advantage seek;</div>
<div>And, perfection not attaining,</div>
<div>I must still continue weak:</div>
<div>Blefs me so in all my striving,</div>
<div>So direct me in my living,</div>
<div>That, in all sincerity,</div>
<div>I may humbly walk with thee.</div>
<div>8. When I fall, make me observant,</div>
<div>Careful lest I fall again;</div>
<div>Haste to strengthen then thy servant,</div>
<div>That my course I may maintain;</div>
<div>Warn me! - ever go beside me!</div>
<div>Daily on - still onward - guide me!</div>
<div>Till I reach eternal rest!</div>
<div>With thy perfect image blest.</div>
<div>These lines describe my feelings as plain as language can exprefs
them. E. Barnes</div>
<div>This notice was put in the Okemos paper some time after all the
children had left home.</div>

<div>Notice</div>
<div>Whereas my wife Esther Barnes has left my board and domicil
without any just or lawful caus e what ever. this is to forbid all
persons from harboring or trusting her on my account a s I will pay no
debts of her contracting after this date.</div>
<div>Meridian Sept. 10 1869</div>
<div>Myron W. Barnes</div>
<div>The estrangement is assumed to be caused by Esther falling in love
(or lust) with another man. She would have been pre-menopausal at the
least. I guess human nature doesn't change, it is just that today's
woman is more free to indulge in affairs without serious repercussions.
</div>
<div>Esther is not on the 1870 census with Myron. There is a domestic
servant in Brooklyn, Jackson County of the right age. Born in
Connecticut, her name is given as Esther B. Hurlbut. It is not known if
this is our Esther. </div>
<div>She did return to her husband in time to be counted for the 1880
census.</div>

<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>The mid 1800s saw vast westward migration from the east coast
along the Great Lakes through Canada. The early settlers had the sheer
tenacity and strength, as they found their way through the dark forests
and deep woods with the hope to carve out their new homes in these
parts of the country. These people migrated along with some basic
tools, and most importantly an iron will power to survive. Melzor
Turner was one such individual who took the risk. Historical references
indicate that Melzor crossed Lake Erie on a frail bark, first stopped
in Ohio, then in Washtenaw County and finally came over the old log
trail on an ox-cart to Ingham County. Okemos was called Sanford in
those days and there were just two other pioneer families living in
this area namely the Brays and the Marshes. Melzor was joined by his
wife and five children later. He was a veteran of the war of 1812 and
was entitled to some land&#8230; Indians who lived in the area, curious to
see a white child would come and peek through the Barnes House windows,
laugh and leave!</div>
<div>The earlier homes of the settlers were built by carpenters. Thus
they were simple and reflected their traditional ideas with perhaps
some local modifications&#8230; Freeman Bray one of the early settlers, had
operated a tavern. Later on Caleb Thurber operated the 'Union Hotel' in
Okemos...what was then called 'the struggling village east of East
Lansing'. </div>
<div>&#8230; the last Township election in the summer of 1869 and according
to a copy of petition in Ms Jessie Turner's possession the 36 tax
paying electors of Meridian township who signed the petition were
interested in bringing the railroad to Okemos and they asked for an
election for the purpose of voting to aid the Lansing Howell Rail Road
Company&#8230; traveling theatrical groups who performed in the upstairs of
the Heathman-Herre House often spent the night in the Barnes House,
which served as the main stagecoach inn. </div>

<div>Notes for Myron Walter Barnes*:</div>
<div>The family, as far as I knew, always knew Myron as Myron Wesley
Barnes. Now a letter from his father-in-law proves that he was Myron
Walter Barnes.</div>
<div>From "A History of Ingham County, Michigan" Early Settlements
(Durant), page 278</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Myron W. Barnes was born in Columbia Co., NY, in 1811. About 1835
he removed to Genesee County [LeRoy] and from thence to his present
residence on the southwest quarter of section 33, in 1842, arriving
October 2d. On the 8th of October in the same year he entered at the
government land office forty acres, to which he has since added forty
acres. [The governmental land records shows a purchase of 40 acres June
1, 1848 - a copy of this land patent is included in these records.] His
land was densely timbered, and he built the first log house between
Okemos and the county farm the same fall. From the time he arrived
until he had his house ready for occupation, his family were domiciled
in the dwelling of Freeman Bray, at Okemos, then called Hamilton. His
family then consisted of a wife and three small children. Mr. Barnes
was a cabinet- and chair-maker by trade, and had never cut down a
primeval forest-tree in his life when he sat down upon his land in
Michigan. When his cabin was ready to "raise" he traveled two days to
find men enough to help put it up.</div>
<div>Previous to coming West he had worked at his trade in New York and
New England. His ancestors were originally from Connecticut.</div>
<div>The county was almost entirely a dense wilderness in 1842, and
wild animals were plenty, particularly deer, bears, and wolves. Mr.
Barnes said "the bears carried off, first and last, more than fifty
hogs in the neighborhood." There were no roads, and traveling was among
the lost arts. In front of Mr. Barnes' residence is a fine row of
locust-trees, which he raised from the seed. He has also a large
fruit-orchard and good improvements. He remembers his old trade, and
still keeps a shop for doing his own repairing.</div>
<div>Excerpts from "How Okemos Began: A Short History" by Ruth
Stillman, sponsored by the Friends of the Okemos Library</div>
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>In 1842 Mr. Bray made one of his horse and wagon trips to Detroit
and brought back with him the Myron W. Barnes family. Finding a
suitable location on a hill about a mile south of Marsh's home (3716
Okemos Road) Mr. Barnes built a log house, the only home between
Hamilton village and the present Holt Road... But to return to the
Barneses -- they had brought with them locust tree seeds which they
planted along the trail side and which produced a row of fine trees.
Some of the bushy growth of this row may still be seen as one travels
along Okemos Road.</div>
<div>There was only a rough, stump-strewn trail through the dense woods
between the Marsh and Barnes homes, and wild deer, bears and wolves
were a common sight by day and sound at night, oft-times a real
nuisance as well. The story is told that Mrs. Barnes started out to go
to the Marsh's to spend the day sewing. A short distance from their
house she saw wolves slinking along side the path behind the
undergrowth. She began to run and ran all the way over the rough trail
with the wolves keeping pace beside her. One can imagine her relief on
reaching the neighbor's house.</div>
<div>Mr. Barnes was a cabinet and chair maker by trade and did custom
work for the new families as well as clearing off a good sized farm.</div>

<div>The resident taxpayers in the township of Meridian in 1844

<div>The township of Meridian was organized by an act of the
Legislature approved Feb. 16, 1842. It had formed a part of the old
township of Alaiedon since March 15, 1838. The first township-meeting
was appointed at the house of George Matthews, where it was probably
held in the spring of 1842. The old record covering the years 1842-44
has been destroyed by fire, and we have only the recollections of early
settlers to aid us in furnishing the names of the earliest township
officers. According to the statements of Joseph H. Kilbourne, Freeman
Bray, M.W. Barnes, and others, though somewhat contradictory, we make
out the following list: [names deleted except Myron]</div>
<div>1843 Treasurer</div>
<div>1853/54 1856 Clerk</div>
<div>1859 Supervisor</div>
<div>1846 Myron tied with Alanson Calkins for Justice of the Peace.</div>
<div>The race was decided by lot - Calkins won</div>
<div>A steam saw-mill was erected at the station by Uriah Moore and
Asbury Long about 1871. It has since been the property of William
Gibson and Morris Brown; Enos Woodworth and Gibson; Woodworth and Henry
Coller; Coller and M.B. Barnes</div>

<div>"... Another cabinet-maker and farmer was Mr. Barnes, who lived
south of the village. In early times he made ox yokes. Farmers came
from every part of the county to get his ox yokes. When Mr. Barnes was
