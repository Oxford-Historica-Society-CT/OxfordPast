"Enos
          Candee appears to have bought the
          place of the executors of the estate of John Twitchel, March
          26, 1804.
          The description is 'five acres more or less, with house, barn
          and store
          theron standing". In 1801 the Records show that John Twichel
          owned the
          place. It was shortly after this time that tradition states
          that
          Morning Star Lodge, Free accepted Masons was organized in this
          house.
          Certain it is that there was a close connection for many years
          between
          the place and the Masons. However, the Records show that the
          Masonic
          Hall was built shortly after this time, and the house could
          not have
          been used as a meeting place for very long..." <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On looking over the Records of the
          Congregational
          Society, I find that the meeting of October 6, 1741 called to
          decide on
          the place to build a meeting house, was held at the house of
          John
          Twichel. This carries our history back 163 years." <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Surely then, considering all of these
          things, we
          have done a good work in restoring this house for the use of
          the church
          with which it is connected by the ownership of several of its
          members,
          and the residence of two former Rectors, the Rev. Aaron
          Humphrey, and
          the Rev. John Anketell..."</big></p>
      <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"> <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
          photograph shown on page 86 was given to
          the present owners of the house by Percy Hamilton Goodsell,
          Jr., who
          wrote the present owners of his recollections of the history
          of the
          house in November, 1966. </big>
        <blockquote><br>
          <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enclosed is the promised photograph
            of the
            Candee sisters and their mother, my great-great grandmother.
            She was
            Elizabeth Perkins, born in Watertown on January 7, 1799, and
            died
            October 10, 1885. She married Enos Candee, who was born in
            Oxford, July
            22, 1792 and died there, February 10, 1786*. Unfortunately,
            I cannot
            identify all the sisters, but I do know that the second from
            the right
            in the rear row is my great-grandmother, Eunice, born
            September 19,
            1821. She married on January 1, 1840, John Austin Peck and
            died in
            Naugatuck on January 28, 1903. The third from the right in
            the rear was
            the eldest daughter Elizabeth, who was born November 14,
            1819. The one
            at the right in the front row is Hannah Augusta, who was
            born November
            17, 1828, and married on November 18, 1858 to Frank Hall.
            She is the
            only one I ever saw, and that was when I was only three or
            four. The
            story is that Elizabeth refused to wear a black dress, like
            all the
            others, but insisted on wearing gray. There are several old
            copies of
            this picture in the family, and in all of them some unknown
            hand has
            blacked in Elizabeth's dress." </big><br>
          <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was much interested in Mr. Peck's
            record, especially since it controverts what I have
            understood about
            the history of your house. I had been led to believe that it
            was built
            by Caleb Candee, the grandfather of Enos, who was born in
            West Haven in
            1722 and moved to Oxford where he died October 4, 1777. He
            is buried
            with his wife, Lois Mallory, in the Jack's Hill Cemetery.
            One of their
            sons was Job, born in Oxford, April 20, 1760, where he died
            December 2,
            1845. He and his wife, Sarah Benham, are buried in the
            Church Hill
            Cemetery. He was wounded in the hand at the burning of
            Fairfield during
            the Revolution."<br>
