It
          is
          Saturday and the time is noon -- hear the wail of the siren
          atop the
          Oxford Center Firehouse. It's a good idea to test a warning
          system.
          It's nice to know that help can be called when and if there is
          an
          emergency. Think back to the year 1798 and how emergencies
          were handled
          in those days. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were fires and crimes then as there
          are now,
          and definitely the townspeople, during the years of the
          Revolution,
          were conscious of the dangers inherent in a war situation.
          What
          actually would have happened in Oxford Center in the
          Revolutionary Ere,
          if British warships were observed approaching the Connecticut
          shoreline, or worse, if a British regiment was seen marching
          toward
          what is now called "the Valley"? How would the people of
          Oxford been
          prepared to meet such an emergency? <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a very interesting question, and it
          is
          difficult for those living in the twentieth century to imagine
          exactly
          how such a situation might have been met. There were no sirens
          for
          there was no electricity. The only means available for
          sounding an
          alarm in those days were a bell, a rider on horse-back or a
          drum.
          Today, when the alarm is sounded, groups of dedicated
          volunteer firemen
          are available to answer the call. During the colonial period,
          who would
          have answered the bell, or the horseman, or the drum? <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every township worthy of the name had a
          militia, a
          group of able bodied men, willing to sacrifice their time and
          talents
          to meet the needs of the community. In the center of Oxford,
          during the
          Revolution, there was a large green. Oxford Road, as we know
          it in
          1973, did not exist. The old road came north from Seymour, as
          it does
          now; but instead of going through the center of Oxford, it ran
          behind
          Victory Park and up Riggs Street to Academy Road. It turned a
          sharp
          left on Academy Road and ran past the Congregational Church,
          and then
          made a large sweeping circle around the center green, to what
          is now
          Dutton Road. The road continued up the hill, and through the
          woods
          until it crossed Governor's Hill Road, and then continued in a
          northerly direction until it met what is now called Hogsback
          Road. (In
          the old days, we called it Pig's back Road.) <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may wonder how I know what the old town
          looked
          like during the Revolution and during the time of
          Incorporation. Please
          allow me to introduce myself. My name is Chauncey Judd, and I
          lived
          during the Revolution, and played an active part in the
          affairs of
          Oxford during those days. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the age of fifteen years, I began to
          attend all
          the training sessions of the militia which were held on the
          Oxford
          Center Green. Every Saturday, at noon I heard the sound of the
          field
          drum which called all of us to muster. We marched, and we
          drilled, and
          we practiced with muskets, pitchforks, and clubs. And as
          youths filled
          with the spirit of adventure, we almost looked forward to the
          day when
          we might be called upon to defend our little town against a</big></p>
