" &nbsp;A little further on the left we come to a very old house known as the Washington Benham homestead. It is located on the corner of the Chestnut Tree Hill road and the Woodbury turnpike and was built about the beginning of the 18th century. It is a house that would attract attention from a stranger, being of the gambrel roof style of architecture that was little known a century ago. Mr. &nbsp;Benham lived in this many years. &nbsp;He was married three times. My memory does not serve me in regard to the names of his wives. &nbsp;He had three children, two sons, and one daughter, John, who married Jessie Perry of Oxford and now lives in Beacon Falls, on the farm formerly owned by Stiles Fairchild. &nbsp;Geo. Benham lives in Seymour, and the daughter Hattie married Wm. O. Davis and lives in Seymour. Mr. Benham moved to Beacon Falls.<br> &nbsp;The place then passed into the hands of Orrin Tucker and soon he commenced to make the famous Oxford doughnuts and established a very profitable business in this line and the sale of the Tucker Doughnuts extended from Danbury to New Haven. He carried on this business for many years until from old age and infirmities he retired and moved to Milford where he died several years ago.<br>(NOTE: &nbsp;The Washington Benham Homestead is house #81 in the EARLY HOUSES OF OXFORD, CONNECTICUT book, published 1976, Historic House Committee of &nbsp;Oxford's Bicentennial Commission)." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-09.html.</p>
