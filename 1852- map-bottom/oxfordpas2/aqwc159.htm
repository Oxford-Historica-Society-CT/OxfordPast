" &nbsp;Continuing our journey up the Riggs Street road, the next place after leaving the home of Frank A. Leek is the old Hatch homestead, the home of Chauncey Hatch during the latter years of his long and useful life. About the year 1835 he built the house, which is scarcely one and one-half stories in height, and of colonial style and architectue, with several ells and wings, more for convenience than looks. Uncle Chauncey, as he was called was a shoemaker and worked at the business all his life. He built a shop on the opposite side of the street where he spent the most of his time repairing shoes for the residents of the town. In his early life he always tanned his own leather. His tan yard was located farther up on Riggs street road. While excavating for a pipe line from a spring to the Episcopal parsonage some time ago the workmen uncovered some of the planking in a good state of preservation that had been buried there for over a century.<br> &nbsp;Mr. Hatch was twice married. I do not recall the name of his first wife. His second wife was Susan Blackman, of Newtown. Three children were born by the first marriage, Julia Augusta and Chauncey Miles Hatch (Notice of whom has been given in a previous chapter.) Julia married Boyel Fairchild of Newtown, and reared quite a large family. Mrs. Kate M. Davis, widow of the late Wm. H. Davis, of Chestnut Tree Hill, is I believe the only survivor. She lives at the old homestead. He was much given to charity, especially if in a good cause. He gave the land where now stands the Episcopal church. He was considered one of the social men of Oxford and at one time owned a good portion of the village. He died Dec. 24th, 1865, aged 73.<br>(NOTE: &nbsp;The Chauncey M. Hatch Homestead is house #85 in the EARLY HOUSES OF OXFORD, CONNECTICUT book, published 1976, Historic House Committee of &nbsp;Oxford's Bicentennial Commission).<br> &nbsp;A short distance farther we come to the ruins of what was once the Capt. Dwinel Chatfield place. This house was built in the early part of the 18th century, the land being given to Mr. Chatfield by Chauncey Hatch providing that he build a house and pay the taxes as long as the house should remain occupied by him, or any other parties as long as the house was occupied. Mr. Chatfield was a blacksmith. He built a shop opposite the house and at that time was the only blacksmith in Oxford and did a thriving business for nearly forty years, until he was obliged on account of old age and infirmities to retire. He died about the year 1853, at the age of 75 years. After his death the place was occupied for many years by Michael Flim, who still continued to pay the taxes, until his death some years ago when it was purchased by Raymond Perry, of Oxford, who dismantled the old house rather than pay taxes on worthless property.<br> &nbsp;The old shop, the house and the barn, all have fallen to decay and nothing remains of one of Oxford's oldest land marks.<br> &nbsp;A little farther north, on the corner of the street leaidng to the center, we come to another old landmark, known as the Moody Brown place, but it was formerly owned and occupied by Chauncey Hatch, in his early life, and I am quite sure he was born in this house." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-10.html.</p>
<p><a name="2216C17"><sup>17</sup></a>B. H. Davis, <I>Reminiscences of Oxford</I>, Chapter 11. " &nbsp;Leaving the home of Frank A. Leek we will continue our journey up the Riggs Street road. The first place well worthy of notice is the Hatch homestead, the home of Chauncey M. Hatch. He was born in Oxford in 1779, the son of Abijah and Sarah Bassett Hatch, who lived in the house now owned by R. G. Robinson. &nbsp;In his early life he had a strong desire to become a cabinet maker, to which his youthful ambition aspired, many articles of his manufacture attesting his skill, but his father objected and desired him to become a shoemaker, so he learned that trade and followed the vocation through life although he disliked it.<br> &nbsp;He was twice married. His first wife was Julia Garrett. They were married Feb. 3rd, 1803. They had four children. Julia Anna who married Royal Fairchild of Newtown, Caroline and Catherine who both died in infancy, and one son, Chauncey M., Jr. notice of whom has been given in a previous chapter. His first wife died March 19, 1840, and he married for his second wife, Hulda Curtis of Newtown, who died in march, 1876. &nbsp;Mr. Hatch was a valued citizen of his native town and at times held most of the offices within the gift of his townsmen.<br> &nbsp;He was a man of sterling integrity and of iron will and dauntless energy; and of good character, a good counselor, a sincere friend and a conscientious Christian.<br> &nbsp;He was a member of the Masonic fraternity for over forty-five years, being a charter member of Morning Star lodge, which was first organized in Oxford, and during all that time he never swerved from his fealty to the order in the days of its persecution and opposition.<br> &nbsp;In politics he was a Jeffersonian Democrat. He held the office of town treasurer for a long period of years and was never defeated at any election for any office he aspired to, so popular was he with his townspeople.<br> &nbsp;He served in the War of 1812, but I do not know how long he was in service. &nbsp;an anecdote of his enlisting was related by one of his descendants. the recruiting officer, a townsman, remarked, "there is one democrat in town has got to be drafted," and it seems this man owed Mr. Hatch a bill and he replied, "Pay me what you owe me and I will be in New London before your company gets there," and he was.<br> &nbsp;He was actively identified with St. Peter's church and was one of its most valued officers and for many years was senior warden, doing faithful service.

" &nbsp;Leaving the home of Frank A. Leek we will continue our journey up the Riggs Street road. The first place well worthy of notice is the Hatch homestead, the home of Chauncey M. Hatch. He was born in Oxford in 1779, the son of Abijah and Sarah Bassett Hatch, who lived in the house now owned by R. G. Robinson. &nbsp;In his early life he had a strong desire to become a cabinet maker, to which his youthful ambition aspired, many articles of his manufacture attesting his skill, but his father objected and desired him to become a shoemaker, so he learned that trade and followed the vocation through life although he disliked it.<br> &nbsp;He was twice married. His first wife was Julia Garrett. They were married Feb. 3rd, 1803. They had four children. Julia Anna who married Royal Fairchild of Newtown, Caroline and Catherine who both died in infancy, and one son, Chauncey M., Jr. notice of whom has been given in a previous chapter. His first wife died March 19, 1840, and he married for his second wife, Hulda Curtis of Newtown, who died in march, 1876. &nbsp;Mr. Hatch was a valued citizen of his native town and at times held most of the offices within the gift of his townsmen.<br> &nbsp;He was a man of sterling integrity and of iron will and dauntless energy; and of good character, a good counselor, a sincere friend and a conscientious Christian.<br> &nbsp;He was a member of the Masonic fraternity for over forty-five years, being a charter member of Morning Star lodge, which was first organized in Oxford, and during all that time he never swerved from his fealty to the order in the days of its persecution and opposition.<br> &nbsp;In politics he was a Jeffersonian Democrat. He held the office of town treasurer for a long period of years and was never defeated at any election for any office he aspired to, so popular was he with his townspeople.<br> &nbsp;He served in the War of 1812, but I do not know how long he was in service. &nbsp;an anecdote of his enlisting was related by one of his descendants. the recruiting officer, a townsman, remarked, "there is one democrat in town has got to be drafted," and it seems this man owed Mr. Hatch a bill and he replied, "Pay me what you owe me and I will be in New London before your company gets there," and he was.<br> &nbsp;He was actively identified with St. Peter's church and was one of its most valued officers and for many years was senior warden, doing faithful service. He gave liberally towards the erection of the new church.

" &nbsp;Continuing our journey up the Riggs Street road, the next place after leaving the home of Frank A. Leek is the old Hatch homestead, the home of Chauncey Hatch during the latter years of his long and useful life. About the year 1835 he built the house, which is scarcely one and one-half stories in height, and of colonial style and architectue, with several ells and wings, more for convenience than looks. Uncle Chauncey, as he was called was a shoemaker and worked at the business all his life. He built a shop on the opposite side of the street where he spent the most of his time repairing shoes for the residents of the town. In his early life he always tanned his own leather. His tan yard was located farther up on Riggs street road. While excavating for a pipe line from a spring to the Episcopal parsonage some time ago the workmen uncovered some of the planking in a good state of preservation that had been buried there for over a century.<br> &nbsp;Mr. Hatch was twice married. I do not recall the name of his first wife. His second wife was Susan Blackman, of Newtown. Three children were born by the first marriage, Julia Augusta and Chauncey Miles Hatch (Notice of whom has been given in a previous chapter.) Julia married Boyel Fairchild of Newtown, and reared quite a large family. Mrs. Kate M. Davis, widow of the late Wm. H. Davis, of Chestnut Tree Hill, is I believe the only survivor. She lives at the old homestead. He was much given to charity, especially if in a good cause. He gave the land where now stands the Episcopal church. He was considered one of the social men of Oxford and at one time owned a good portion of the village. He died Dec. 24th, 1865, aged 73.<br>(NOTE: &nbsp;The Chauncey M. Hatch Homestead is house #85 in the EARLY HOUSES OF OXFORD, CONNECTICUT book, published 1976, Historic House Committee of &nbsp;Oxford's Bicentennial Commission).<br> &nbsp;A short distance farther we come to the ruins of what was once the Capt. Dwinel Chatfield place. This house was built in the early part of the 18th century, the land being given to Mr. Chatfield by Chauncey Hatch providing that he build a house and pay the taxes as long as the house should remain occupied by him, or any other parties as long as the house was occupied. Mr. Chatfield was a blacksmith. He built a shop opposite the house and at that time was the only blacksmith in Oxford and did a thriving business for nearly forty years, until he was obliged on account of old age and infirmities to retire. He died about the year 1853, at the age of 75 years. After his death the place was occupied for many years by Michael Flim, who still continued to pay the taxes, until his death some years ago when it was purchased by Raymond Perry, of Oxford, who dismantled the old house rather than pay taxes on worthless property.<br> &nbsp;The old shop, the house and the barn, all have fallen to decay and nothing remains of one of Oxford's oldest land marks.<br> &nbsp;A little farther north, on the corner of the street leaidng to the center, we come to another old landmark, known as the Moody Brown place, but it was formerly owned and occupied by Chauncey Hatch, in his early life, and I am quite sure he was born in this house." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-10.html.</p>

Robinson. &nbsp;In his early life he had a strong desire to become a cabinet maker, to which his youthful ambition aspired, many articles of his manufacture attesting his skill, but his father objected and desired him to become a shoemaker, so he learned that trade and followed the vocation through life although he disliked it.<br> &nbsp;He was twice married. His first wife was Julia Garrett. They were married Feb. 3rd, 1803. They had four children. Julia Anna who married Royal Fairchild of Newtown, Caroline and Catherine who both died in infancy, and one son, Chauncey M., Jr. notice of whom has been given in a previous chapter. His first wife died March 19, 1840, and he married for his second wife, Hulda Curtis of Newtown, who died in march, 1876. &nbsp;Mr. Hatch was a valued citizen of his native town and at times held most of the offices within the gift of his townsmen.<br> &nbsp;He was a man of sterling integrity and of iron will and dauntless energy; and of good character, a good counselor, a sincere friend and a conscientious Christian.<br> &nbsp;He was a member of the Masonic fraternity for over forty-five years, being a charter member of Morning Star lodge, which was first organized in Oxford, and during all that time he never swerved from his fealty to the order in the days of its persecution and opposition.<br> &nbsp;In politics he was a Jeffersonian Democrat. He held the office of town treasurer for a long period of years and was never defeated at any election for any office he aspired to, so popular was he with his townspeople.<br> &nbsp;He served in the War of 1812, but I do not know how long he was in service. &nbsp;an anecdote of his enlisting was related by one of his descendants. the recruiting officer, a townsman, remarked, "there is one democrat in town has got to be drafted," and it seems this man owed Mr. Hatch a bill and he replied, "Pay me what you owe me and I will be in New London before your company gets there," and he was.<br> &nbsp;He was actively identified with St. Peter's church and was one of its most valued officers and for many years was senior warden, doing faithful service. He gave liberally towards the erection of the new church. He gave not only the land where it stands, but furnished a good amount of capital.<br> &nbsp;He always had a warm spot in his heart for young people, and especially for the school boys, who were wont to go to him for favors which he cheerfully granted.<br> &nbsp;The parents of his first wife were in the Wyoming massacre and her mother escaped from the fort under the guard's arm carrying a three week's old child in her arms and remained hidden in the brush in sight of the dreadful scene and saw here brother killed. She made her escape on horseback, riding to Southbury without adventure.<br> &nbsp;A granddaughter, Mrs. Kate M. Davis, widow of the late William H. Davis, resides in the old homestead. She is the daughter of Royal and Julia Anna (Hatch) Fairchild and inherits many of the traits of character of her grandfather. She is actively identified with St. Peter's church and is untiring in her labors for the welfare of the society.<br> &nbsp;Chauncey M. Hatch died Dec. 20th, 1850, aged 79 years.<br>(NOTE: &nbsp;The Hatch Homestead is house #85 in the EARLY HOUSES OF OXFORD, CONNECTICUT book, published 1976, Historic House Committee of &nbsp;Oxford's Bicentennial Commission)." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-11.html.</p>
