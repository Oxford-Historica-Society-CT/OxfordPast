" &nbsp;A little further on the left we come to a very old house known as the Washington Benham homestead. It is located on the corner of the Chestnut Tree Hill road and the Woodbury turnpike and was built about the beginning of the 18th century. It is a house that would attract attention from a stranger, being of the gambrel roof style of architecture that was little known a century ago. Mr. &nbsp;Benham lived in this many years. &nbsp;He was married three times. My memory does not serve me in regard to the names of his wives. &nbsp;He had three children, two sons, and one daughter, John, who married Jessie Perry of Oxford and now lives in Beacon Falls, on the farm formerly owned by Stiles Fairchild. &nbsp;Geo. Benham lives in Seymour, and the daughter Hattie married Wm. O. Davis and lives in Seymour. Mr. Benham moved to Beacon Falls.<br> &nbsp;The place then passed into the hands of Orrin Tucker and soon he commenced to make the famous Oxford doughnuts and established a very profitable business in this line and the sale of the Tucker Doughnuts extended from Danbury to New Haven. He carried on this business for many years until from old age and infirmities he retired and moved to Milford where he died several years ago.<br>(NOTE: &nbsp;The Washington Benham Homestead is house #81 in the EARLY HOUSES OF OXFORD, CONNECTICUT book, published 1976, Historic House Committee of &nbsp;Oxford's Bicentennial Commission)." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-09.html.</p>

Five children were born to them -- four daughter and one son ... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiram Osborn was a very much valued citizen of his native town, coming here as a poor boy, but by his honest and upright dealing he soon gained the respect and confidence of all with whom &nbsp;he came in contact. Early in life he became actively identified with St. Peter's Church, and every Sunday you would see his pleasant face and his good wife seated in one of the front pews listening attentively to the drafting of the Gospel. He filled at times nearly all the offices of trust within the gift of this townsmen.<br> &nbsp;He represented the town in the legislature several times. He gave largely to charity. The latch string was always out at his door and no one ever went hungry form his threshold. He was much given to cattle and sheep raising. He was one of the largest land owners in the town and I might almost quote from an old saying that the sheep upon a thousand hills were his. He was a man of sterling ability, a good counselor, a warm friend and a sincere Christian.<br> &nbsp;Grandma was a great favorite with all the young people and she always had a kind word and pleasant smile for all.
