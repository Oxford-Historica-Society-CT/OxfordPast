" &nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly opposite the Thompson place is the old original Cable homestead which was owned and occupied by Roswell Cable. He came to Oxford from Monroe about the time the hat shop started. He married Hannah Chatfield of Oxford and located on the farm and learned the hatter's trade and also ran the farm by the aid of hired help. He kept the town's poor for many years and those who were able helped in the farm work towards paying for their keeping. The old house, which is still standing, was built in the latter part of the 17th century, by whom I am not able to mention, but it was considered a very old house fifty years ago. Ten children were born to Roswell and Hannah (Chatfield) Cable.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Agar E., married Sarah E. Davis, daughter of Burritt and Electa Davis.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Julia married Wilson H. Clark, a prominent lawyer of New Haven.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Fred'k O. Married Sarah E. Davis, daughter of Burritt and Electa Davis.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Mary Ann married George Sperry of Bethany.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Laviola married Alonzo Leek of Oxford<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Hanford R. married HIlda Whittaker of Susquehanna, Pa.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Glover W. married Sarah Van Houten of Oswego, N.Y. 2nd, married Elizabeth Hatch, daughter of Chauncey M. Hatch of Bridgeport.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Hannah J. married G. M. Winter of Oswego., N.Y. &nbsp;He was a railroad conductor on th eErie road and at the time of his death, about two years ago, he had been in the employ of the Erie road fifty years and never had an accident.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Betsy married Nathan Johnson. He was a merchant in Ansonia and carried on business there for many years. He died in Waverly, N.Y.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Horace died young, was never married.<br> &nbsp;Of the ten children only three are living. Frederick O. now in his 83rd year, lives at Yorkville Heights, N. Y. with his daughter, Mrs. Lincoln PIerce; Herman J. lives in Oswego, N.Y., and Glover W., the youngest son, who has lived on the old homestead most of his life. &nbsp;Several years ago he purchased the Stephen Thompson farm lying opposite the old place and removed the old structure, enlarged the cellar and built one of the finest residences in this part of the state. &nbsp;The location is one of the bet and from the spacious veranda one has a view of the surrounding country of many miles, and on clear days one can see Long Island Sound and the vessels sailing thereon.<br> &nbsp;Mr. Cable learned the carpenter trade with the late Frederick Beecher and John Davis of Seymour and has worked at that business in connection with his farm work. He is one of the foremost in town affairs and has represented the town twice in the Legislature, has been selectman a number of years, and tax collector and has at various times filled most of the minor offices in town. &nbsp;Eight children were born to Glover W. and Elizabeth (Hatch) Cable -- Betsy, Henry, Fred, Nelson, Julia, Horace, Emma and Lillian.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Betsy married Sherman Sanford and lives in Seymour<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Fred and Henry are married and live in Torrington<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Julia married Walter James and lives in Seymour<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Emma married Pearl Robinson of Oxford who now resides in Shelton and is in business in Derby.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Lillian married Chas. Pope, son of John B. Pope of Oxford.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Nelson is married and lives at Oxford.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Horace is employed by E. K. Tomlinson, in Seymour, at carpenter work." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-04.html.</p>

He married Mary Ann Cable of Oxford, a Sister of Glover W. Cable. There was but a small portion of land belonging to the place and Mr. Sperry worked for the nearby farmers. &nbsp;For many years he was in the employ of Burrett Davis, engaged in getting ship lumber. During the September gale in ?? a tract of lumber on the Davis farm was blown down and Mr. Sperry was employed to convert this fallen lumber into railroad ties and lumber for the Naugatuck R. R. which was build about that time. &nbsp;Some of the timber was used to build the railroad bridge over the Naugatuck at Seymour. After the fire which burnt the Davis farm, Mr. Sperry gave the family shelter until the new house was completed the following May. He was a good hearted man and a good neighbor. He died about 1861. His wife afterwards married a Mr. Doolittle of Seymour who lived on his farm on the Skokorat road. Some time after his death she went to Oswego, N.Y., where she died." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-04.html.</p>

" &nbsp;Just a little north opposite the Smith place stands another land mark, known as the Hawley place. David Hawley, Jr., formerly owned this place and lived here for many years. The house was built about the year 1830. &nbsp;Chester Smith of Chestnut Tree Hill was the builder.<br> &nbsp;Mr. Hawley was twice married. &nbsp;His first wife was Mary F. Doolittle, of Skokorat, daughter of Edmund Louis Doolittle of that place. They were married May 27, 1863. &nbsp;Two daughters and one son were born to them, Jane E., now Mrs. George A. Candee, of Skokorat, a daughter who died in infancy, and a son, Otis Hawley, a prominent citizen of Seymour, who also lives on the old Doolittle farm on Skokorat.<br> &nbsp;Mr. Hawley's second wife was Martha Gillette of Great Hill. One son was born of this marriage, Clifford Hawley, who lives with his mother on the road leading from the Southford Cemetery to Christian Street. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of Mr. Hawley in 1897 the place was sold to James Pendleton who occupied it for a year or two and then it was sold to W. Stafford who worked in the Seymour Iron foundry, consequently did not make a success of farming." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-18.html.</p>
