"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Among the negroes that had been brought to Derby from the West Indies was a man named Pero, belonging to Deacon Riggs, who lived on the road, called from him Riggs Street, leading from Derby to Gunntown and Waterbury. Pero was supposed to be a native African; indeed, he used to boast that he was of royal blood.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My fader, said he was king in his own country. He had plenty of wives, and heap of soldiers. My mammy she lived in a house in de bush; she had nice mat and calabash, and was one great lady. But one day, when my fader and his men was huntin', white man come and burnt all de houses. Den dey took my mammy and her two boys, - one younger dan me, - and drove us away to de ship. It was a bad time we had on de water. My poor little brother died, and dey trow him in de sea. Mammy cry and go crazy when dey takes him away from her, and when we got to Jamaica, she die too. I's a picka-ninny den, - little feller, - and I feel very bad to lose my mammy. But de new tings I see made me forgit, in little while. Dey sends me 'way to de sugar plantation, where I fared very well. Massa was kind to me, and I had little to do but lie in de sun, and suck de sugar-cane.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But this lazy life of indulgence did not last long, and he was soon made to feel what slavery is. I know not how he came to be sold, but he had scarcely arrived at manhood before he found himself removed to Connecticut, under the comparatively mild ownership and authority of the good Puritan Deacon Riggs. In due time, by consent of his master, he took to himself, as a wife, Hagar, a slave of Rev. Dr. Mansfield. By her he had two sons, Tobiah and Laban, - both noted persons in their day, - and perhaps other children."</p>

" &nbsp;In continuing the reminiscences of Riggs street we will leave the main road nearly opposite the residence of Ransom Hinman and follow a crossroad for about three-fourths of a mile when we come to an ancient farm house known as the Andrews place. &nbsp;This house was built some time in the seventies of the 17th century, by a man named Finch, who lived there many years and reared a family of five daughters. &nbsp;I remember one very distinctly, the youngest, Sarah, who married Hiram Osborn. The place was vacant for several years until about the year 1854. &nbsp;The farm was then purchased by Nehemiah Andrews of Bethany, then comparatively a young man. He was twice married. &nbsp;HIs first wife was Phinette of Bethany. Seven children were born of this union, two daughters and five sons, namely:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Jay<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* John<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Dwight<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Adeline, married Charles Northrop of Woodbridge<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Emily married Leverett Lindsley, formerly of Oxford, now located at Emporia, Va.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Dennis, married a widow lady form Shelton, named Fowler.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* George, married Sarah Crandall of Woodbridge.<br> &nbsp;The only ones now living of this family are the two daughters, Adeline and Emily. Dennis, Jay, George, John and Dwight all died while yet in their young manhood.<br> &nbsp;The second wife of Mr. Andrews was Miss Nancy Alling, daughter of Eli Alling of Oxford. Six or seven children were born to them and I think they are all living. &nbsp;Frank, of Oxford; Mary, lives in Newark, N.J.; William, somewhere in Montana; Charles in Seymour; Mrs. Fox (I don't recall her first name), lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Idella in Oxford (NOTE: She married Orlando Osborn, see below). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Andrews lived on the old homestead 35 years. He was a practical up-to-date farmer, and his crops alway showed good care and cultivation. For several years he catered to the wants of th e town's poor, and no one had cause to complain of the treatment they received under his care. &nbsp;His death occurred Feb. 16, 1880, aged 76. Nancy, his wife, died April 4, 1908.<br> &nbsp;Frank, who now owns and occupies the place, is a thrifty farmer and takes an active part in everything pertaining to the welfare of the town. He has a nice family and some of his boys are identified with the bit and auger industry in Seymour." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-14.html.</p>
