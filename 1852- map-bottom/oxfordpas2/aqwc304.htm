" &nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the home of G. W. Cable, the next place is known as the Chester Smith homestead. The house is of antique design, one and a half story, and was built in the latter part of the 17th century. Uncle Chester, as he was known was twice married. By his first marriage three children were born, Merritt and Stiles, who resided in New Haven, and Polly, the daughter, married Bennett Twitchell of Bethany, where she lived after her marriage and died there a number of years ago. the two sons died in New Haven.<br> &nbsp;By his second wife he had two daughters, Augusta, who married Charles Riggs and lived in New Haven, where she died in 1911, at an advanced age; and Esther Athelia, who married Benjamin Beach of Cheshire. Three children were born to them: Charles, Minnie and Samuel. &nbsp;Charles and Minnie deceased; Samuel lives in Bridgeport.<br> &nbsp;At the breaking out of the Civil War Mr Beach enlisted, we have been told, in the 20th C. V. &nbsp;He was taken prisoner but was soon exchanged and just before the Battle of Chancellorsville he died. &nbsp;Athelia, his wife, died April 15, 1884,<br> &nbsp;Chester Smith was a carpenter and a good one. He built the Oxford Hotel, which stands as a monument to his memory, and many other buildings in and about Oxford Center are specimens of his handiwork. &nbsp;The place is now owned and occupied by Mrs. Sperry.<br>(NOTE: &nbsp;The Chester Smith Homestead is house #137 in the EARLY HOUSES OF OXFORD, CONNECTICUT book, published 1976, Historic House Committee of &nbsp;Oxford's Bicentennial Commission)." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-05.html.</p>
