" &nbsp;As we proceed on our jnourney north we come to another old house which is well worth mention. This place is known as the Osborn homestead. The north portion of the house was built by Harvey Osborn about the year 1820. After the house was finished he married Eunice Smith of Oxford, June 10th, 1820. One son was born to them, George B. Osborn, who lived with Bennett Davis for many years and was instrumental in saving the life of the writer at the time of the fire that destroyed the farm house of Bennett Davis, Nov. 12, 1849.<br> &nbsp;The first wife of Harvey Osborn died July 16, 1828. On Jan. 15th, 1830, he married Nabby Davis, one of the twin daughters of Col. John Davis. &nbsp;He died in 1842. After his death Aunt Nabby lived at the old homestead until 1860 when she went to New Rochelle, N. Y., to live with a relative. She died there July 21st, 1874.<br> &nbsp;The place was afterwards sold to Edwin Alling and some time in the year 1909 the place was sold to Charles Baldwin of Seymour, who occupied it only a short time." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-19.html<br><br>Note from Karen Bauer Bryant:<br> &nbsp;George's mother died when he was young. Burritt Davis is the brother of his father's second wife, Abigail Davis. She is shown living with Burritt on the 1850 Oxford census. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The house that burned in 1849 belonged to Burritt Davis. Burritt's wife, Sarah Electa Osborn, was George's cousin. She was the daughter of Hiram Osborn, one of Harvey's brothers.</p>
