                    <h3>As we prepare to open Mr. Munn'a one-room 1850's schoolhouse for Oxford's student programs, we seek community donations and support in purchasing supplies for the schoolhouse.</h3>
                    <p><strong>Notes from a 1850 Christmas in 2023</strong></p>
                    <p>Holiday decorations will once again add a seasonal touch to Oxford’s Twitchell-Rowland Homestead Museum from 2-4 p.m. on Sunday, December 4 and 18 and on January 2, 2023. The Museum is located at 60 Towner Lane, off Route 67 in Oxford.</p>
                    <p>Of special interest is this year’s featured display “Gifts from the Past,” a collection of family treasures loaned by members of the Oxford Historical Society evoking memories of long ago. Included are a toy barn and animals from 1947,  a porcelain teapot used on Christian Street in the early 1900s, a nightgown worn by Rowland family children at the Homestead c1926, and Native American basketry and beading from the early 20th century. A lit Christmas Village completes the festive special offerings.</p>
                    <p>Gifts such as notecards and books of local history will be for sale. Docent led tours of the museum’s three rooms will be available. Admission is free and cider and cookies will be served. The display can also be seen by special appointment by calling Nancy Farnum at 203 888-0230.</p>

                <p>Visiting students will be able to see how much the United States map has changed when they study a large 1850’s map of the United States and the various territories not yet states.</p>

                <p>Students in 1850 used to small slate boards practice writing and do their math assignments, because paper was very expensive. Slate was cheaper and reusable. Actual student slates, made from stone, and edged with wood are available. The Society hopes to purchase about 25 authentic slate boards to provide an authentic 1850's school day for Oxford's children.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Students in 1850 were taught to use quill pens. Usually made from turkey feathers, the base of the feather was trimmed to make a point which could be dipped in ink for penmanship prac- tice. We hope to obtain quill pens and ink wells for our student visitors to use. Instructions for making quill pens are available or group would like to make them, or they could be purchased ready-made. We'd love to hear from someone or group who would provide them for Mr. Munn’ schoolhouse use.</p>

                <p>With patriotism high in pre-Civil-War New England, portraits of the first American President George Washington and the President Benjamin Harrison were common schoolhouse necessities. We plan to place these in Mr. Munn’s schoolhouse</p>

                <p>McGuffey Readers were the standard classroom instruction books of American classrooms in 1850. Students advanced through books by reading level. The levels do not correspond to present-day reading student grades. The stories stressed American history, manners, animal, courage, honesty, God and love of reading. Children visitng Mr. Munn’s Schoolhouse will be able to read a variety of stories students would have enjoyed when Marcus S. Munn taught in this private boys school in Oxford.</p>

                <p>A dunce cap and stool were considered essential supplies in an 1850’s one-room schoolhouse. The pointed hat was used as an article of discipline in schools in Europe and the United States especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries for children who were disruptive or were considered slow in learning. Students visiting the 1850’s Mr. Munn Schoolhouse will see this out-dated form of school discipline. We trust that the stool and cap will not be required in this century.</p>

                <p>In 1850, Mr. Munn’s Schoolhouse would have featured a 30-star flag. Accurate reproduction 30-star flags are available for $120. We hope our supporters will enable us to purchase one for the opening of the schoolhouse.</p>
