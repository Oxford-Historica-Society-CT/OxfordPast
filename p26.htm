Sharpe
          also lists a mill in the Punkups
          area, which was founded by James Dawson, an Englishman. The
          property
          was also originally owned by a man by the name of Lees, who
          later had a
          son named Robert Lees. Dawson and Lees sold out to Ira Bradley
          and
          William Guthrie, and later the mill was sold to James and
          Samuel
          Radcliffe of Bristol. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time there was a screw manufacturer
          at Quaker
          Farms, operated by H. E. Bidwell on Eight Mile Brook, about a
          mile
          south of the present Route 188. The small screws were sold to
          hardware
          dealers throughout the state, and parts of New York and
          Massachusetts
          states. The firm also manufactured auger screws for sale in
          Seymour and
          Westville, and shear screws for manufacturers of shears in
          South
          Britain and Naugatuck. It is said that a sawmill was also
          operated here
          at that time. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Red City Daguerreotype and ambrotype
          cases were
          made, and later William Tucker had a shop there for the
          manufacture of
          wagon wheels and horse equipment <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous sawmills were in operation,
          throughout the
          town. In addition, hay rakes were built by Isaac Towner on the
          main
          road in the Center <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheldon Church, in 1852 owned a sawmill and
          nearly a
          square mile of land in timber. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was even at one time a turning shop,
          which
          manufactured croquet sets. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A familiar name is found in a sawmill which
          originally was owned by William and Sheldon Church, and was
          later
          leased to Edward L. Hoadley. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time there were eight dams with
          shops and
          mills in the area now comprising Oxford. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also a cider distillery on Rock
          House
          Hill. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major industry was the manufacture of
          hats, and
          casks and kegs were made for the West Indian trade. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also a number of shoe shops in
          the area,
          with shoes being exported to the city of New Haven and to the
          south
          there was a shoe shop at the south end of Riggs street,
          several on the
          main road from the Center to Southbury, and one in Quaker
          Farms. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrance O'Neil, who is an Oxford native,
          recalls
          that there was a button factory on the O'Neil Road, about 100
          yards
          north of the bridge. He spoke also of a grist mill at the pond
          below
          that location. The pond, known as Bidwell's Pond, also was the
          location
          of a sawmill, and a cider mill. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just as you cross the bridge north of that
          bridge
          on the stream where the eight mile brook comes to Lake
          Quassapauge,
          there is an old wagon factory up in there, about 100 yards
          in," he
          recounted. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also in early times a copper mine
          on the
          southeast of Copper Mine Road, which was owned by George Lum.</big></p>
