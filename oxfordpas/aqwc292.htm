This house was built in 1796 and was owned by Enos Lum, who lived there all his long and useful life. He married Lois Osborn, daughter of Hiram and Sarah Finch Osborn. He was a stone mason and was engaged all during the construction of the Naugatuck R. R. in building bridges and other mason work. He was also employed in the same capacity on the Housatonic R. R. for a long time. After these roads were completed he engage d in farming until enfeebled by old age and infirmities. He then retired from active labor and passed the rest of his life in ease and comfort.<br> &nbsp;When his son Fred returned from California he gave his father $500 in gold coin. the old man fearing to keep so much money in the house buried it in some secluded spot, and before he died did not reveal the hiding place. But designated a rock at the west of the house. Diligent search was made for the gold but it could not be found. Finally he secured the services of a man in Middlebury named Wooster, who had the reputation of discovering buried treasure. He came and with his divining rod went over the whole farm, but with no result, and as Fred reported afterwards, the only thing that he located was the pork and cider barrels in the cellar, both of which were empty soon after. The &nbsp;money has neve been found and very likely never will be unless by accident.<br> &nbsp;The place was afterwards sold to ? Roberts who renovated the old house and built an up to date farm, and for many years engaged in breeding and raising thoroughbred horses. It was an ideal place for the business.<br> &nbsp;Enos Lum died April 17, 1875, aged 79.

"STORY OF TIMOTHY JOHNSON'S PART IN THE REVOLUTION<br>as related by Judge N. J. Wilcoxson.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Timothy Johnson related to me an incident that I must not omit to mention. The corps of which he was one, was on the bank of the Hudson, under Gen. Wayne, and in presence of Washington. Wayne besought Washington for a permit to lay siege to the British fortress on the bank of the Hudson called Stony Point. Wayne was refused permission. He besought a second time. Washington said the undertaking was too hazardous, it could not be successful, and refused him permission, believing it would be but a sacrifice of men, Wayne, nothing daunted, applied a third time to the Commander-in-Chief for his permit; told his plan and expressed his confidence of success. This he did with earnestness, such as told of the will to his purpose. Permission was granted him. He was allowed to pick his men. Timothy Johnson, my narrator, was one chosen, and as I think he said, his brother Phineas was another. The men chosen, they marched onward to the onslaught. Washington re-viewed them as they passed -- he looked very sober, and thought they would all be killed. They were marched in to the enemy's picket. They halted. They were fast. Wayne came along with a piece of bread and meat in his hand, saying, "Blood may run in rivers; any one who desires it may leave the ranks and he should not be branded with cowardice." But one left. Wayne then went through the line of troops and took the flints from every gun, that there should not be a gun fired giving light for the enemy's aim. The night was densely dark. All made ready and about to commence the march. Wayne said, "Death to the man that attempts to leave or falters in duty." Onward they marched and soon came upon the enemy's picket. The picket hailed. No answer. He fired and ran. Wayne and his force ran after him, The fortress was encircled with the limbs of the apple trees piled high and thick, the twigs of which were sharpened to a point, so that it would be impossible to get over or break through.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But said Mr. Johnson, "We were so close upon the sentinel or picket, that he could not fill the gap made for him; we ran through the same and so entered the enclosure."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy in the meantime kept up a brisk fire, but not a man was hit. They made up to the walls of the fort and set about scaling. The man first over the wall was killed, the only one lost of the detachment. The contest was sharp and and severe, but short. The British soldiery surrendered. Wayne received a severe wound with a cutlass over the eye, a cut in such a manner as to cause the eyelid to fall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He bled like a butcher," as it was told to me. Wayne said that he would ever proud of carrying the scar of that wound." http://www.oxfordpast.com/p10.htm.</p>
