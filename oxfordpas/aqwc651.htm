" &nbsp;We next come to the old Tubal Sanford &nbsp;homestead. This, like many of the old landmarks, is fast going to ruin and decay and will soon be numbered with the things that have been. Uncle Tubal, as he was familiarly called, was a soldier in the war of 1812, enlisting Sept. 13th, under Capt. Medad Hotchkiss. &nbsp;Where or how long he served is not on record. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He was twice married. His first wife was Polly Newton of Woodbridge. &nbsp;They had four children, Eliza married Lewis Tolles of Bethany; Mary Ann, who married Smith Botsford of Seymour; and two sons, John and Ellsworth, who went to New Haven and resided there and were engaged in the grocery business for a number of years. &nbsp;His second wife was Lucinda M. Barnes of Naugatuck. By the second marriage, three children were born -- Polly, who married Egbert Burnham of Naugatuck, and Delia, who married Bennet Scoville of Oxford. the son, Charles S., married Caroline Smith of Middlebury. he is still living but is blind and very infirm and is cared for by the town. &nbsp;The place was recently sold to Stephen Gazey. Tubal Sanford died April 14th, 1871, aged 87 years.<br> &nbsp;Just above the last named place we branch off from the main road and follow the mountain or short cut road that was used by the early settlers to travel to Naugatuck, thereby saving about one and a quarter miles each way." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-07.html.</p>
