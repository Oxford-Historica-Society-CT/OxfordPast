" Joseph was son of Thomas, the third in a succession of Thomas Judds, who were among the colonial magnates, enjoying the highest offices and honors of the community. The first was one of the little band that made their long journey, in 1635, through the woods from Massachusetts to the banks of the Connecticut, carrying the wife of their pastor, Rev. Mr. Hooker, in a litter upon their shoulders. Afterward, removing to Farmington, he was the first deacon of the church there, and very often a deputy to the General Court."</p>
