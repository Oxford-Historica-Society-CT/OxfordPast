<p><a name="1026C8"><sup>8</sup></a>Revolutionary War Pension File. " ... 16th day of August 1832 ... Job Candee a resident of Oxford ... aged 72 years ...<br> In July 1776 I volunteered as a musician for the term of three months in a company commanded by Captain Isaac Beecher of New Haven and a few days after my enlistment into said company we sailed from New Haven to New York where we joined Colonel Jabez Tompson's Regiment. We were placed in Queen Street in the city of New York and remained there about three weeks as I now think and were then ordered to Long Island where we remained a few days during which time it rained incessantly. The British Army was in plain sight of us (at Flatbush) while we were on the Island and about 26th or 27th of August a skirmish took place between our army and the British and the Americans retreated back to New York in the night. When we were crossing from the Island to New York we lay down in the boats, it being considered a precautionary measure although the night was very dark.<br> We took our quarters in Queen Street as before and remained there a few days, when seven British armed ships sailed up the East River, and ankered at a place called Turtle Bay, a short distance above the city. We kept our station in Queen Street, and the British kept on board their ships for several days, during the nights of which we were engaged in digging entrenchments at Bulls Head near Turtle Bay.<br> Early in the morning on or about the 7th or 8th of September the British landed from on board their ships at Turtle Bay and the American Army on the same day retreated to Harlem about seven miles north of New York. &nbsp;Colonel Tompson's Regiment was the last that left the city and left about 12 o'clock noon. The rest of the American Army left the city at an earlier hour in the day. On our retreat we were fired at by the British and Colonel Tompson and several others were killed.<br> The next day after we retreated to Harlem we were engaged in the morning in raising a ___ work and in the afternoon a battle was fought between the American and British Armies in which the British met a partial defeat and retreated back towards New York. We remained at Harlem until the expiration of the said term of three months which expired in the forepart of October in said year and then we returned to West Haven in Connecticut. On our retreat to and with 4 or 5 miles of Harlem we found a man whom I supposed belonged to some other Regt that had retreated before us, in a state of insensibility and when we first came upon him we thought he was dead, but on examination found that he breathed and had probably sunken under fatigue. We took him in a blanket and by taking turns we carried him to Harlem and I understood he got well - his name I never knew. While we were at Harlem we lived in bush huts and effected an entrance into New Haven in that way.<br> They burnt several buildings on the wharf, plundered the city and then returned on board their ships, sailed down the sound.<br> They had some 12 Pounders on board the boats that came to the shore when they landed for I was fired at when on guard and saw one of the balls strike in the water near the shore and when the tide went out I went onto the edge of the water and got the ball and the same is in my possession now it weighs 12 pounds. The last mention of time of service was twelve months and was the term for which I enlisted.<br> On the 3d day of April 1780 I again enlisted in the same Captain Bradlee's company and under the same Lieutenant Kimberly. Served a term of nine months at West Haven. The company was divided and commanded as in the term lat mentioned.<br> At the time of this enlistment to wit on the 3d day of April 1780 the understanding between myself and the officers was that I would serve as long as should from circumstances be necessary and I enlisted accordingly for and indefinite period of time.<br> In April 1777 I volunteered and went to Danbury but did not arrive there until that place was burnt, General Wooster was killed a little distance from Danbury at the same time I was out but three or four days and then returned home.<br> On the 9th day of February A.D. 1778, I enlisted in a company of Artillery which was commanded by Captain Phineas Bradlee and Lieutenant Asel or ___ Kimberly. The said company consisted of about 100 men and was kept up for the defense of New Haven, It was also divided into three divisions and I think it was some of the time into four. &nbsp;One was stationed at New Haven, another at East Haven, and another under the command of Lieut. Asabel or Asel Kimberly and to which I belonged at West Haven. Capt. Phineas Bradlee commanded the Division at New Haven but I do not recollect the officers names who commanded at East Haven.<br> In the first part of July A.D. 1779, 2000 British amd Tories landed at West Haven and attempted to cross to New Haven over the West Haven Bridge, but we opposed them and they went around through Tompson ____<br> While we were at West Haven during the last mentioned term of nine months, we had frequent skirmishes with the British, as they frequently ___ from Long Island in the night .... We were dismissed from this term of service on the first day of January 1781.<br> On the 27th day of July A.D. 1781, I then living in Oxford, in the State of Connecticut, it then being a part of the town of Derby, I took the place of Alexander Johnson, who had been drafted for a term of three months, __ the Militia, and was in the Militia for the said Alexander Johnson for said term of three months, in a company commanded by Capt. Joel Hotchkiss, Lieutenant ___ Porter, and Ensign Henry Tomlinson. Colonel Canfield commanded the Regiment. We marched to West Point, through the towns of Newtown, Danbury, etc., and was out a term of three months at West Point. At said West Point ... When our time was out we were dismissed and I returned home to Oxford. The only memories of the company that I was in at this time, and who served with me, of whom I have any recollection, are Henry Tomlinson who was the Ensign, and Daniel Chatfield, and Jeremiah M. Kelle, who were, I believe, privates. All the rest I believe are dead. When I entered the service as when stated = July 1776, I lived at West Haven, now called Orange, Jeremiah Smith now living in said Orange was a member with us in Captain Bradlee's company, and was with me in the same. I know of no other living member of said company.David Humphrey was ___ of the Regiment, to which Captain Bradlee's company was attached. Samuel Candee, of Oxford was a member of Captain Baldwin's company, in the same Regiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;... that in the 9th day of February A.D. 1779, I enlisted in a company of Artillery ... under Captain Phineas Bradley, at that time I lived in said West Haven (now Orange). Jeremiah Smith and Thomas Painter, now of said Orange, were members with me in said last mentioned company. At the time of my enlistment in the 3d day of April 1780, I lived at said West Haven. Jeremiah Smith was a member with me of said company at said last mentioned date and was in the same company the same length of time that I was in, I think. &nbsp;.... Each of said companies that I enlisted in were Connecticut State troops. I never belonged to the Continental Army. I was born in Oxford on the 20th day of April 1760. .... I removed to West Haven when I was nine years of age, and was placed as an apprentice to the black smith ... There I lived until I was about 21 years old. Then I removed back to Oxford ... I never received any written discharge. I have no documentary evidence to effect my claim. I am known to Hon. William Bristol, Hon. David Bassett, Hon, Nathan Smith and others of which are Rev. Asbel Baldwin, Rev. M. Brown, Samuel Wire, Noah Stone, and numerous others of Oxford who can testify to my character for veracity, and their belief of my service as a Soldier of the Revolution." http://www.oxfordpast.com/JobCandee.pdf.</p>
