<p><a name="18878C1"><sup>1</sup></a>B. H. Davis, <I>Reminiscences of Oxford Homes and People</I> (Seymour Record - 1913), Chapter 15. <http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/davis-toc.html>. " &nbsp;Continuing on Riggs Street, leaving the Osborn Homestead, we come to quite an imposing house which was built about the year 1820 and was owned and occupied by John Buckingham during most of his lifetime. &nbsp;The writer has no record of who he married, but he had three children, two sons and one daughter.<br> &nbsp;Marcus was born in 1828 and lived at home until he was about 0 when he went to Ansonia and engaged in the butchering business with the late Ely Hotchkiss and continued with him for several years, when he went into business for himself, about the year 1863, when Burritt Davis became a partner with him under the name of Buckingham & Davis. This continued about 18 months, Mr. Davis then retiring from the firm.<br> &nbsp;Soon after he formed a partnership with Julius Bristol of Milford who continued with him until failing health caused him to retire from business.<br> &nbsp;He married a daughter of Simeon Bristol of Milford. He accumulated quite a fortune, and at his death having no issue he gave his entire fortune to the Y. M. C. A., of Ansonia, and the building they built with the money stands as a monument to his memory.<br> &nbsp;Henry, the youngest brother, also lived at home until the commencement of the Civil War when he enlisted in the 20th Conn. Volunteers, and was engaged in several battles, and I have been informed that he was killed in the battle of the wilderness, certain he was never seen or heard from after that.<br> &nbsp;Henrietta, the daughter, lived at home, and when she was quite young she aspired to become a school teacher. Her first experience was in the old schoolhouse just north of her home. &nbsp;She taught there for several terms, and afterwards taught the Chestnut Tree Hill school. &nbsp;After several years, having taught in nearly every district in the town, she opened a select school at Oxford center, in the building that was once the Masonic hall, now occupied by Sanford & Pope as a store. She was a model teacher and fond memory takes me back to those halcyon days as the happiest of my existence. There were twenty that attended her school in the early part of the sixties, but now there are only six of them living, Sarah Dunham Fairchild of Seymour, Nettie Candee Perkins of New Haven, Mary J. Lum Warner of New Haven,, Julia Chatfield Thomas of New Haven, G. W. Cable and B. H. Davis of Oxford.<br> &nbsp;Several years ago Miss Buckingham went to Los Angeles, California, where she died about six years ago at an advanced age." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-15.html.</p>
