The pleading cry of distress rose from the cellar, and was heard by the family above. It was more than Mrs. Wooster could bear. Her sympathies indeed, in political matters, were those of her husband and her sons. She was willing to render aid and comfort to those of that party in all ordinary matters, and did not scruple even to share in the spoils of the late expedition; but she was not yet ready for murder, unprovoked, and in her own special premises. She was a woman, nay, more, she was a mother. The young man whose lot it had been to fall into these cruel hands was a son, innocent and amiable. His mother was her neighbor, against whom the tongue of scandal was never heard to speak. She could not, and she would not, let such a deed of shame be done in her house.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to one of her elder daughters to accompany her, she hastened down stairs, and threw herself between the victim and his murderers, who were just preparing to execute their purpose.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For shame! she cried. Are you men, or wolves, to kill a poor boy in this way? I tell you, it shan't be done, - not in this house! Mr. Wooster, for God's sake, come down here and stop this villainy!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Better not meddle with what does not concern you, said he, descending the stairs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;It does concern me, she repeated. I'll not have murder committed here. Let him alone, Sam! Take your hands off him, Captain!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;She was a large and powerful woman, and once thoroughly aroused was a match for any antagonist. Her husband took her by the arm and bade David seize the other to drag her away. But she resisted their united strength, and at last, turning at bay, she cried, -<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;David Wooster, hear me! Stop these proceedings this moment, and spare the life of that boy, or by the God that made you, I'll go this very day and let the whole of it be known, the robbery and the murder both. Yes, Captain Graham, I'll have the rebels hold of you before night, if you touch a hair of his head again. See if I don't!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The loud tones of the excited woman, accompanied by the shrieks of her daughter, were irresistible, Wooster himself relented, for he knew the spirit and resolution of his wife, and saw that informers from his own family would be more dangerous than the testimony of the young man himself, while the added crime of murder would bring the entire party to the gallows.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Captain, he said, a willful woman must have her own way. You will have to give up to her. It is a rather hard case, I own ..."</p>
