      </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">Talked with docent who led the classes. They do the second grade. They have wall board desks and attached benches.

She goes over the Three R's:

      </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">READING:</span>
Use McGuffey Readers. Have made individual booklets, stapled copies
from the McGuffey Readers. Starts with a few pages from the first
reader, then some from the second, third and fourth readers. Shows them
how accent marks are used in the text, how the text also includes
cursive writing. Each student uses an individual photocopied reader.
They get to read aloud together and singly, if time permits.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WRITING: </span>She writes a phrase or sentence on the main schoolboard, and the students all copy that, using quill pens.

      </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ARITHMETIC; </span>She
puts four arithmetic equations on the board, and each student solves
them, one at a time on their little chalk board with chalk. They solve
the first one, and when the teacher or assistant say it is correct,
they can go on to the next one, and through the four equations.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
      <span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SUPPLIES: </span>Little
chalk board for each student, chalk, quill pens, ink, McGuffy
reproduction compilations, Graces, other period games for outdoors.</span>
